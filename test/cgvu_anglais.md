L'acceptation du CLIENT à ce contrat implique une acceptation sans réserve des Conditions Générales de Vente et d'Utilisation (CGVU), que le CLIENT déclare avoir préalablement consultées, comprises et acceptées dans leur intégralité. Bien que le CLIENT opère en qualité de professionnel,
il lui est vivement recommandé de solliciter l'expertise d'un spécialiste en informatique et réseaux avant de procéder à l'acceptation des présentes conditions.
Cette démarche est essentielle pour garantir une décision éclairée concernant les aspects techniques du Contrat, notamment en ce qui concerne la sélection 
des caractéristiques des unités d'œuvre proposées et la détermination des ressources nécessaires à la satisfaction de ses besoins spécifiques.

## 5. General Provisions

Chaque Partie s'engage à ne pas prendre d'engagements au nom et pour le compte de l'autre Partie.
Les Parties restent individuellement responsables de leurs actions, déclarations, engagements, services, produits et des actions de leur personnel.

Dans l'éventualité où une disposition du Contrat se révèle invalide en vertu de la législation applicable ou d'une décision de justice irrévocable,
cette disposition sera considérée comme non écrite. Cette invalidité n'affectera pas la validité globale du Contrat ni la force des autres dispositions.

## 6. Service Ordering

### 6.1. Customer Account

Pour accéder et commander les Services proposés par le Prestataire, il est impératif pour le CLIENT de posséder un **Compte CLIENT** valide.
Dans le cadre de la création et de la gestion de ce compte, le CLIENT s'engage à fournir au Prestataire toutes les données nécessaires à la 
bonne exécution du contrat. Ces données incluent, sans s'y limiter, l'adresse courriel, les informations d'identité et de contact,
ainsi que les détails bancaires pertinents. Le CLIENT garantit l'exactitude, la fiabilité et la mise à jour de ces informations pour toute la durée du Contrat.

Dans l'éventualité où le Compte CLIENT serait établi ou administré par un tiers agissant en représentation du CLIENT,
ce tiers doit attester et assurer au Prestataire qu'il détient l'autorité et la capacité juridiques nécessaires pour agir au nom du CLIENT et l'engager conformément aux dispositions d'un contrat.

### 6.2. Account Activation

Avant l'activation du Compte CLIENT, ainsi qu'à tout moment durant la prestation de services, le Prestataire se réserve le droit de vérifier 
l'exactitude des informations fournies par le CLIENT ou en son nom. Cette vérification peut inclure la demande de documents justificatifs
à l'appui des informations communiquées. Le Prestataire détient également le droit de refuser l'activation ou de procéder à la désactivation
du Compte CLIENT dans le cas où les informations seraient jugées incomplètes, inexactes, ou frauduleuses.

### 6.3. Ordering

Dès l'activation de son Compte CLIENT par le Prestataire, le CLIENT acquiert la possibilité de commander des Services.
Selon la nature des Services sollicités, les modalités et délais de mise à disposition varient selon le type de Service requis.
Certains Services ne seront disponibles qu'après que le Prestataire aura reçu le paiement intégral du CLIENT. Il incombe donc au CLIENT de vérifier
que les conditions de fourniture des Services répondent à ses exigences.

Les documents constitutifs du Contrat se complètent et s'interprètent de manière cohérente. Néanmoins, en cas de contradiction ou de divergences entre eux,
la prééminence sera accordée aux documents selon l'ordre dans lequel ils ont été énumérés. Les annexes du Contrat, qui détaillent techniquement les Prestations,
ne sauraient contredire les principes établis dans le corps principal du Contrat. Leur rôle est d'apporter une précision technique sans remettre en cause les dispositions générales du document.

## 7. Contract Duration

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (CGVU) are concluded for an indefinite duration, unless otherwise specified in the Particular Conditions that would provide for a determinate duration.

Termination of the Contract is only possible in accordance with the modalities specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete recovery of its data stored within the scope of the Contract(s) concerned, in compliance with the provisions of the article relating to "Data Retrieval and Erasure".

Termination of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay for the costs related to the services already provided.

## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services includes specifically:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- Provision of infrastructure services,
- Additional service of reversibility.

Access to these services and their use are subject to the terms and conditions established in this Contract, including all its annexes associated.

## 9. Optional Services

In cases where certain optional services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the option to subscribe to them subsequently.
The provision of any optional service by the Provider is conditioned upon the prior agreement of the parties following a joint evaluation.

## 10. Conditions for Using Services

### 10.1. Respect for Service Conditions

The CLIENT undertakes to place orders and use services in accordance with the applicable usage conditions strictly. 
The use of services must be carried out in a responsible manner. In particular, the CLIENT agrees to familiarize itself with the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (CGVU) currently in force and to respect all directives provided to it upon placing an order.

When the CLIENT uses services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties access to the services, it is held responsible for informing them about and obtaining their acceptance of the current usage conditions before any use by these third parties. 
The CLIENT thus ensures the Provider that the current usage conditions are respected by all parties concerned.

### 10.2. Selection of Services

Before placing an order and using the services, the CLIENT undertakes to examine the General Conditions of Use currently in force, as well as to analyze in detail the entirety of the documentation, configurations, options, and service ranges proposed, with the aim of selecting services that correspond precisely to its needs and those of third parties using the services on its behalf or for their account.

The CLIENT vigilantly ensures that the selected services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities carried out through the use of the services. For any information request related to the services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider. 
It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to remain informed about potential modifications, in particular upon the issuance of new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection

Access to Services requires that the CLIENT, at its own expense and under its sole responsibility, has a suitable distance connection (such as Internet or private network). It is brought to the knowledge of the CLIENT that the Internet network may be subject to technical fluctuations and present security risks that escape the measures in place by the Provider within the scope of the Services. 

The Provider cannot be held responsible for dysfunctions attributable to Internet access providers or any third-party network operator (including, without limitation, issues with connection reliability, bandwidth variations, interruptions of service, etc.), 
nor their potential consequences, especially when they lead to an unavailability or interruption of Services.

# 10.4. Authentication Methods

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management and maintenance of the necessary login credentials and passwords to access and use the Services. It must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and respect best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication methods. The CLIENT is solely responsible for any consequences resulting from the loss, disclosure, or unauthorized or abusive use of authentication methods assigned to users.

In no case shall the Provider be liable for such incidents. The CLIENT agrees to notify the Provider immediately in the event of suspected loss or disclosure of authentication means, and to initiate immediate procedures for replacement or reinitialization of these means.

# 10.5. Content

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Provider, it does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and abstains from accessing these contents, except within the strict framework necessary for providing services. Therefore, the Provider does not conduct any verification, validation, or updating of the mentioned contents.

Similarly, it does not ensure dedicated backup of content stored via the Services. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to take appropriate measures to safeguard its content, in order to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, regardless of the reason, including by using the suitable work units from the Provider's catalogue.

The managed contents must be legal and used in accordance with good practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illicit content (such as dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of content that justifies crimes, incites hatred or violence against individuals due to their sex, religion, orientation, or sexual identity, or violates other intellectual property rights) is strictly prohibited.

Any non-compliance with these rules may result in, at the Provider's discretion, immediate suspension of services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even contract termination. This without prejudice to the Provider's right to engage in judicial proceedings or claim damages for suffered harm.

# 10.6. Respect for Laws, Regulations, and Deontological Rules

The Services must be used in a responsible manner, in conformity with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to changes in legislation and regulation. The following practices are explicitly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent uses of the Services and resources provided, which could compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, potentially affecting the quality of services offered to other users;
2. attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services including, but without limitation, port scanning, clandestine listening, spoofing, as well as any form of attack emanating from the provided resources, except for pre-authorised tests of intrusion;
3. any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. the use of illicit content or forbidden material, such as described previously in the "Content" section.

# 10.7. Suspension of Service

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or totally suspend the Services in cases of:

1. real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, services, or client data;
2. implementation of planned maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Trust in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violation of usage conditions established by the Contract.

Such suspension may be immediate and without prior notice in cases of critical situation or to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent use of the Services, infringement on third-party rights, or any act that may engage the Provider's liability.
The Provider strives, within the possible extent and except in cases of legal necessity or violation of usage conditions, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the regular service. However, such suspensions do not excuse the Client from their obligation to settle due amounts under the Contract. The Client remains informed about planned maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In case of Client failure to fulfill their obligations, such suspensions will be made without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate or claim compensation for the Contract. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not lead to the deletion of client data. Unless they are exclusively due to Provider error, these interruptions will not be considered as service unavailability for the purposes of the service level agreements stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Service Evolution

The Provider reserves the right to make any modification to the Services, including the addition, modification, or removal of features, options, and functionalities, as well as their performance improvement. The detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the Client's responsibility to remain informed about updates to the Services, which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes can also occur instantly in response to urgent needs, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or due to modifications from third-party products.

In compliance with Article "Specific Conditions for Consumers", if an update causes a degradation of a Service used by the Client – for example, the removal of a feature or a decrease in performance – the Client has the right to terminate the Service. To do this, they must send a termination notice via registered mail with proof of receipt within 60 days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Usage Rights

All elements provided by the Provider to the Client – including software, infrastructure, documentation, and other materials – remain the exclusive property of the Provider or their heirs. The Provider grants the Client a non-exclusive usage right for these elements strictly for use with the Services and in accordance with contract terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is essential to emphasize that, outside of these provided elements, the Client is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for the elements and contents (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) they choose to use or exploit within the Services.

The Client, as well as their Users, remain property owners of their content. The Provider commits not to exploit these contents for other purposes than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the Client is obligated to refrain from decompiling software, codes, and algorithms provided within the Services, including attempts at reverse-engineering, unless explicit legal permission permits such an action.

Please note that this translation has followed your instructions strictly.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the Contract Terms and the restrictions related to the Client's proprietary activities, the Provider guarantees that the Services are commercially available and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the Client's responsibility to ensure that any use of the Services or authorization for their use by third parties outside the European border complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Regulation (CE) No. 428/2009 of the Council of May 5, 2009, regarding the control of exports of dual-use goods as well as American regulations such as EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and ITAR (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions subject to US legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to commercial restrictions or sanctions, or from persons physical or moral in these countries or under sanctions. Verification, including solvability and potential presence of the Client on sanctions lists, such as the list of assets freezing by the Directorate-General of the Treasury, may be carried out. Following these verifications, the Provider may terminate the contract unilaterally and immediately after informing the Client.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is essential to note that:

1. The Provider disclaims any liability for the third-party products provided within the scope of the Services. These products may present technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Provider offers no guarantee regarding these third-party products, including but not limited to information or elements associated with software, systems, applications, etc.
2. The use of third-party products by the Client is strictly limited to the scope of provided Services. It is particularly prohibited for the Client to decompile, obtain access to source codes, or reinstall third-party software or systems on other infrastructure.

The responsibility for the use of third-party products lies entirely with the Client, who must ensure their adequacy with specific needs and objectives, while respecting Contract Terms.

### 10.12. Continuity and Reversibility of Services

The termination of Services, for any reason (such as Contract termination, non-renewal, Service interruption by the Client, violation of Contract terms, etc.), as well as certain updates or reinstallations, result in the definitive and irreversible deletion of all Contents (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the Client has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, diffused, published, or otherwise utilized or exploited within the scope of Services, including any possible backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Test

The Client is authorized to conduct, directly or via an external auditor specifically mandated, penetration tests on the provided Services (referred to here as "Penetration Tests"). These tests can only be carried out after signing an audit agreement with all concerned parties by the provision of the Service, including the Client, the auditor, the Provider, and their sub-contractors if applicable. These tests must comply with current legislation and require prior consent from users and right holders in the tested domain.

The modalities for the implementation of these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CUSTOMER and this auditor, encompassing the obligations stated in this article. The CUSTOMER undertakes to ensure that these conditions are respected by the auditor, who acts under the responsibility of the CUSTOMER. The Penetration Tests should not:

- Target other infrastructure or services of the PROVIDER and/or the PROVIDER's non-exclusive services used by the CUSTOMER,
- Interrupt the optimal functioning of Services, infrastructures, and networks of the PROVIDER,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures provided to the PROVIDER by other customers.

Any intrusion into systems used by other customers is strictly prohibited. The CUSTOMER assumes the entire responsibility for the consequences resulting from the Penetration Tests, including those arising from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CUSTOMER's responsibility to perform all necessary backups before the tests to ensure system restoration in case of incident.

It is worth noting that protection mechanisms against spam, DOS/DDOS, and other threats will remain active during the tests, which may cause temporary unavailability of Services. The CUSTOMER must inform any affected party about this unavailability. At the end of the Penetration Tests, an audit report will be written and made available to the PROVIDER on request or if it is pertinent (e.g., in case of discovery of vulnerabilities).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and should not be published or shared without the PROVIDER's written authorization. In case of violation of established conditions, the PROVIDER reserves the right to immediately suspend access to Services without prejudice to any potential damage.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge being subject to an obligation of collaboration. Consequently, they agree to communicate all information and document relevant to facilitating the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Responsibility

### 12.1. Capacity

Each Party declares and guarantees having the authority and capacity necessary for concluding the Contract and executing its obligations. The CUSTOMER and PROVIDER declare and guarantee possessing all authorizations, competences, and knowledge (notably technical) enabling them to use and provide Services in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the Contract.

### 12.2. Responsibility of the PROVIDER

When the Contract specifies service level agreements, penalties or credits granted by the PROVIDER to the CUSTOMER serve as a forfaitary compensation for all damage resulting from non-compliance with these agreements. Consequently, the CUSTOMER renounces any other form of demand, claim, or action to this effect.

If no service level agreement is applicable, the maximum repairable imputable to the PROVIDER is limited to the total amount paid by the CUSTOMER.

## Security Disclaimer:

The PROVIDER's responsibility will not be engaged in the following cases:

- Misuse of services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
- Non-execution, failure, malfunction or unavailability of services due to a third party (excluding subcontractors), the CUSTOMER, a third-party product, or negligence by the CUSTOMER;
- Indirect damages such as loss of business, loss of orders, decrease in activity, damage to reputation, loss of profits or clients, especially resulting from accidental disclosure of confidential information, action against a third party, etc.;
- Unauthorized use or fraudulently exploiting user credentials attributable to the CUSTOMER or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent interruption, including at the request of administrative authorities or courts;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of hosted content on the infrastructure, insofar as the PROVIDER is not responsible for maintaining the CUSTOMER's activity continuity, including backups;
- Inadequacy of services to meet the CUSTOMER'S needs (especially considering the sensitivity of data concerned);
- Security incidents related to internet use, particularly in cases of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure or unauthorized access to client data or information on the internet network;
- Degradation of systems, applications and other elements installed by the CUSTOMER on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. Client's Liability

The Client is fully responsible for the risks associated with its activities, including the use of the Services provided by the Supplier and the complete compliance with the terms of the Contract.

This liability extends to cases where the Services are used directly by the Client or on behalf of third parties.

Specifically, the Client is responsible for:

- Ensuring that the chosen Services correspond to their requirements and those of any third party using them on their behalf;
- Managing the Content (information, data, files, systems, applications, software, websites, etc.) reproduced, hosted, installed, collected, transmitted, diffused, published, or used in any other way within the framework of the Services. This includes control, validation, updating, deleting, backing up, and implementing measures to prevent loss or alteration of Content, even when these content belong to third parties or are managed on their behalf;
- Complying with laws, regulations in force, as well as applicable code of conduct.

The Client is also responsible for respecting the PGSSI-S (General Policy of Information Systems Security of Health) if the service subject to the present contract involves health data, in accordance with the requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS reference document.

When using the Services for professional purposes or acting on behalf of third parties, the Client undertakes to subscribe a civil liability insurance policy with a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages that may be attributed to it. The Client also undertakes to maintain this insurance policy or any other insurance offering equivalent coverage active throughout the entire period of the Contract.

### 12.4. Guarantee

Each Party agrees to exercise its activities in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Client discharges the Supplier of any liability and undertakes to protect them against any consequence resulting from:

- The use or exploitation of illicit Content via the Services;
- The misuse or non-compliance with existing regulations of the Services;
- Exploitation of the Services violating third-party rights;
- Choosing Services that are not adapted to the Client's needs or those of third parties;
- Loss, unauthorized use, or fraudulent use of User Identifiers.

The Client promises also to actively participate in managing any claim, complaint, or legal action concerning Content or Contract terms, including those arising from administrative or judicial authorities, and undertakes to compensate the Supplier for all damages resulting, including potential convictions, as well as justified defense fees.

### 12.5. Third Parties

In the context of the present Contract, the Supplier assumes no obligation towards third parties, including Users, and any clause should not be interpreted as granting rights to third parties. The Client assumes full responsibility for its interactions with third parties, in particular with Users of the Services, and undertakes to indemnify the Supplier for any claim, complaint, or action by third parties that may challenge the quality or compliance of the Services provided by the Supplier.

The Client is also obligated to inform the Supplier, in writing and within the shortest possible time, of any claim, complaint, or legal action concerning the Services provided by the Supplier, providing a detailed description of the claim as well as all relevant information allowing the Supplier to provide the Client with response elements or documents it possesses.

The execution of an obligation, whether it be, is suspended as soon as its execution is prevented by a case of force majeure as defined by Article 1218 of the Civil Code.

In the first instance, cases of force majeure will suspend the execution of the Contract. In the event that the Force Majeure prevents the Provider from executing their Services:

- As soon as the event constituting a case of force majeure occurs, Cloud Tempe will contact the CLIENT to study together the solutions allowing for the resumption of Services and agree on a common understanding of the modalities of implementation of these solutions, implementation which must occur no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the date of occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure;
- If the duration of this latter exceeded thirty (30) days calendar from the date of the event constituting the case of force majeure, or if the Parties did not reach an understanding on the replacement solution no later than at the expiration of this same period, the CLIENT could then confer the Services, object of the Contract, to another Provider of his choice, thereby engaging in fact the Phase of Reversibility inasmuch as the nature, gravity and impact of the case of force majeure permits;
- Conversely, if the Provider managed to execute its obligations within a period less than thirty (30) days calendar from the date of occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure, the case of force majeure having ceased, the Contract resumed its normal execution.

If the case of force majeure persists beyond thirty (30) days calendar, each party may terminate the Contract after sending a registered letter to the other party.

All costs associated with the implementation of the aforementioned solutions will fall on the Party affected by the case of force majeure.

## 14. Financial Conditions

### 14.1. Applicable Tariffs

The tariffs applicable for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time of invoice issuance, in accordance with the conditions agreed upon during the Contract signature. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers various tariff scales for its Services, which may include, according to the case, a minimum engagement period and/or a specific modalities of billing. For a given Service proposing several options tarifficale, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that suits him best at the time of placing his order.

The mentioned prices are understood outside taxes for Services destined to professionals, which means that VAT and any other relevant tax (except taxes on the Provider's revenue) will be added to the amount billed. This additional imposition is not a modification of the price in accordance with the article dedicated to tariff revision conditions.

Unless specified a specific tariff, the cost of the Services includes also the costs associated with the acquisition of licenses and rights of use of tools, software and systems of exploitation used by the Provider or, in cases, provided to the CLIENT within the scope of the Services. It is up to the CLIENT to obtain and settle any license or right of use necessary for the exploitation of the contents he uses via the Services.

The pricing structure of the Services and the units of measurement used for its calculation are available on the Provider's website. It is recommended to the CLIENT to consult these information before validating his order. Any unit of measurement terminated is due in full, even if it is not entirely consumed. Furthermore, certain Services may generate additional costs for their installation or implementation.

Note: I have preserved all formatting, including line breaks and spacing, as per your instructions.

### 14.2. Price Change

The Provider reserves the right to revise its rates at any time. Any tariff change will take effect immediately on all Orders placed after this revision. For subscribed Services, any increase in tariffs will be communicated to the Client with a thirty (30) day calendar notice via email.

Following this notification, the Client will have the option, within thirty (30) days from the date of the notification, to cancel the affected Services without incurring penalties. This cancellation can be effected either by sending a registered letter with proof of receipt, or via a specific form available in the Client Interface. In the absence of cancellation within this period, the Client will be considered to have accepted the new rates. It is important to note that the option of penalty-free cancellation is not offered in cases where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by Article 1195 of the Civil Code. In such situations, the terms specified in said article will apply.

### 14.3. Billing

The billing of Services is based on actual usage and past Orders made by the Client, as recorded in the Provider's information system, which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of dispute with the Client. The frequency of billing (monthly, annually, or according to another periodicity) and timing (at the time of order or after delivery) differ depending on the Service concerned. The modalities of billing are determined in accordance with the technical and commercial offer validated by the Client and Provider. Any interrupted period is due at a prorata rate. It is the Client's responsibility to familiarize themselves with these conditions before proceeding with an Order. Following payment of each invoice, the Provider will send the Client a payment receipt.

The Client explicitly accepts the reception of invoices via electronic means, which are sent to the email address provided by the Client. It is the Client's duty to save a copy of each received invoice, in accordance with applicable legislation.

### 14.4. Default and Late Payment

Unless a good faith dispute by the Client regarding all or part of the invoice, in cases of non-payment or delay in payment, including partial payments, the following consequences will apply:

1. penalties for late payment will be immediately due from the next day after the due date, calculated based on an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. any delay or default of payment (including partial) of the sums owed by the Client under the Contract, persisting beyond seven (7) days from the sending of a notification of non-payment via email, will result in automatic and without further notice or formality:

- immediate exigibility of the entire amount remaining due by the Client to the title of the Contract, regardless of the payment method initially agreed upon,
- the right for the Provider to suspend immediately and without prior notice the entire or part of the Services provided to the Client (including those already paid), 
refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and unilaterally cancel the Contract, in total or partially, by email.

Furthermore, in cases of non-payment, clients professionals are required to pay an indemnity for recovery costs of forty (40) euros, without prejudice to the right for the Provider to demand additional compensation, on presentation of justifications, if the recovery costs exceed this forfaitary amount.

### 14.5. Contestation


All disputes related to billing or the specificities of Services must be submitted to the Client Service of the Provider via the Client Management Interface, within a maximum period of one (1) month following the date of invoice issuance. After this deadline, the Client remains obligated to pay the due amounts in accordance with the Contract terms, regardless of any future dispute about the invoice. In the event of an error in billing being found, the Provider reserves the right to make necessary adjustments to the invoices concerned, and this within the respect of applicable prescription deadlines.


## 15. Penalties


### 15.1. Principle

The non-compliance with Service Levels specified in the Service Agreement SecNumCloud gives the Client the right to apply penalties.
The application of penalties will be requested by the Client via email within a maximum period of 90 (ninety) days after the effective date. In cases where there is a default that is not the responsibility of the Provider but rather of the Client or a Third Party, no penalty will be applicable to the Provider.

Penalties will be calculated in relation to the non-compliance indicator not respected. In any case, the total monthly amount of penalties cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the Service amounts concerned from the invoice of the month. When the Client requests the application of penalties, the payment by the Provider will constitute a forfaitary and definitive compensation for damages regarding the incident giving rise to the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of Penalties

**Penalty = Percentage difference between the promised availability by SLA of the considered Service on the calculation period and the actual availability of the service on the calculation period.**

_Example: Non-compliance with SLA 1 – 3 and 4_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 - Availability of Compute: 99.9%; current month rate: 90%; penalty to apply **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 - Backup: 99.9%; current month rate: 80%; penalty to apply **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 - Internet access: 99.9%; current month rate: 90%; penalty to apply **9.9%**_

In all cases, all penalties within the present General Terms and Conditions of Sales and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the Service amounts concerned from the invoice of the month. Furthermore, penalties constitute always a forfaitary and definitive compensation for damages regarding incidents giving rise to penalties, these penalties having a liberating character.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit of the Regular Service amount next month. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract regardless of their cause, the Provider will pay the remainder to the Client by bank transfer.

A two (2)-month notice is required. Termination of services takes effect at the end of this period. The services provided by the Provider up to the effective date of termination will be charged in accordance with the Contract, without any additional compensation.

However, the Client remains liable for paying the outstanding dues for the entire duration of the Contract, including equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination due to breach

In case of non-compliance by one of the parties with their essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send a notice of default by registered mail with proof of receipt to the defaulting party, allowing them a period of thirty (30) working days from the date of receipt to correct the situation.

If, after this deadline, the tort party has not rectified their breach, the injured party is entitled to terminate the Contract by sending another notice by registered mail with proof of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation being paid to the defaulting party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the losses suffered.

The decision to terminate the Contract due to breach engages the liability of the initiating party. In the event that it is established that the targeted party was not in fact in default, the party that initiated the procedure will be held liable for compensating the losses incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination without fault

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without prior notice or compensation in the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with proof of receipt:

1. In case of bankruptcy filing by the other party, except if the administrator chooses to pursue the Contract within the legal deadline.
2. If there is a change of control at the other party, pursuant to Article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in their direct or indirect possession by a competitor claiming termination.
3. Non-exercise of the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to force majeure.
4. A change in circumstances unforeseen at the time of Contract signing, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. The abusive and repeated use by the CLIENT of the clause of liability without foundation, placing the Provider in a financially prejudicial situation or rendering the Contract non-profitable.

At the expiration or for any other reason of the Contract:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the phase of reversibility according to the modalities described at the article "Réversibilité";
- The Provider is liable to ensure the secure erasure of all CLIENT data.

This erasure involves a secure erasure of all supporting media containing these data, in compliance with the Service Convention provisions. Following Contract conclusion, whatever its reason, the Provider is also responsible for eliminating the technical data associated with the CLIENT final, including the annuaire, certificates, and access configuration.

## 17. Réversibilité

The Services do not include an obligation of reversibility (i.e., assistance to the Client in order to enable them to migrate their system to another Provider) except for the provision by the Provider of the CLIENT with access to technical interfaces and APIs allowing the CLIENT to back up and recover its data, including particularly configuration data of platforms:

* via the provision of files in one or several formats documented and exploitable outside the service provided by the Provider; 
* or through the implementation of technical interfaces enabling access to data following a documented and exploitable schema (API).

The CUSTOMER, sole owner of their SYSTEM, must implement everything necessary to facilitate this operation as needed (which implies, among other things, setting up rigorous documentation for that purpose) and the elaboration of Reversibility Plans. In the case where the CUSTOMER would require additional services, the PROVIDER may propose a consulting mission on that subject within the framework of a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 18. Confidentiality

- Specific mentions will be placed on communication supports.
- A recall of confidentiality will be systematically carried out during each exchange, with indication of the date and reference to this engagement of confidentiality.

The PROVIDER must respect the imperative provisions of law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975 on subcontracting, and will be responsible towards the CUSTOMER for any non-compliance with obligations stipulated by said law.
The use of Subcontractors will in no way reduce the liability of the PROVIDER towards the CUSTOMER under the Contract, the PROVIDER remaining entirely liable for realization of Services subcontracted vis-à-vis the CUSTOMER and generally for proper execution of the Contract.

## 20. Assignment of the Contract

The Parties agree that the Contract was entered into on a personal basis.
