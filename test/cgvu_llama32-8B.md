And all entities, whether it is a physical or moral person, acting as a consumer or a professional, of private or public law, having subscribed to an offer for the provision of Infrastructure-as-a-Service according to the SecNumCloud Reference Model (hereafter referred to as the "**CLIENT**").

For the purposes of this Contract, the CLIENT and the Provider are respectively qualified as "Party" when mentioned separately and as "Parties" when mentioned jointly.
It is noted that the terms used with a capital letter within the scope of this Contract are defined in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, titled "Definitions".

This reformulation aims to clarify and formalize the scope and parties involved in the Contract, while respecting the conventions and precision required in legal language.

__It is hereby noted that the following applies__

The Service Provider positions itself as a specialized operator in the domain of Cloud Computing, offering, among other things, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and professional service offerings (Professional Services).

[https://www.cloud-temple.com]

In the event of discrepancies between one or more provisions contained in the annexed documents, priority will be given to the higher-ranking document.

The most recent and officially approved version of a document supersedes all its previous versions. Therefore,

in the event of divergence among provisions within the same document, it is the later validated version that prevails.

The fact that a stipulation not mentioned explicitly in a lower-ranking document does not render it legally invalid.

## 4. Objective

The present Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Provider agrees to provide the Client with the Services defined,
specifying the scope of application, the modalities of execution of the Performances, and the financial terms associated. The Client commits to this contract in his own name and on his behalf.

Acceptance by the Client to this contract implies unconditional acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (CGVU),
which the Client declares to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the Client operates as a professional,
it is strongly recommended that they seek the expertise of an IT specialist and networks prior to proceeding with the acceptance of these conditions.
This approach is essential for ensuring an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly in relation to the selection 
of the characteristics of the units of work proposed and the determination of the necessary resources to satisfy their specific needs.

## 5. General Provisions

Each Party agrees not to take any commitments on behalf of and for the account of the other Party.
The Parties remain individually liable for their actions, declarations, commitments, services, products, and personnel actions.

In the event that a provision of the Agreement is found to be invalid in accordance with applicable legislation or an irreversible judicial decision,
this provision shall be considered as non-existent. Such invalidity shall not affect the overall validity of the Contract nor the strength of other provisions.

## 6. Ordering Services

### 6.1. Client Account

For access and ordering of the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the Client to possess a valid **Client Account**.
In the context of creating and managing this account, the Client agrees to provide the Provider with all necessary data for the proper execution of the contract.
These data include, without limitation, email address, identification and contact information, as well as relevant banking details.
The Client guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and updating of these information for the entire duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT ACCOUNT were established or administered by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT,
this third party must attest and ensure to the Provider that it holds the authority and legal capacity necessary to act on behalf of the CLIENT and engage them in accordance with the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT ACCOUNT

Before activating the CLIENT ACCOUNT, as well as at any time during the provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify 
the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include the request for supporting documents
in accordance with the communicated information. The Provider also retains the right to refuse activation or to activate/deactivate the 
CLIENT ACCOUNT in the event where the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Command

As soon as the Client's Account is activated by the Provider, the Client acquires the possibility to order Services. Depending on the nature of the Services requested, orders can be executed via the dedicated Client Management Interface. The Client assumes full responsibility for managing their Account, including securing authentication means (logins, passwords, etc.) associated with them.

Any command made from the Client's Account is considered to have been carried out by the Client themselves and carries their full and entire consent to the Contract terms.
The modalities and deadlines for providing the ordered Services vary according to the type of Service required. Certain Services will only be available after the Provider has received full payment from the Client. It is therefore incumbent upon the Client to verify that the provision conditions for the Services meet their requirements.

The constituent documents of the Contract are completed and interpreted consistently. However, in cases of contradiction or divergence between them, precedence will be given to the documents in the order they have been listed. The Appendices of the Contract, which detail technically the Services, cannot contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without undermining general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the contract

Contracts established under these General Conditions of Sale and Use (CGVU) are concluded for an indefinite duration, unless otherwise specified in the Particular Conditions that would have provided a determinate duration.

The termination of the Contract is exclusively possible in accordance with the specifications outlined at Article "Termination". Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete retrieval of their data which were stored within the scope of the relevant Contracts, in compliance with the provisions of the article relating to "Data Retrieval and Erasure".

The cessation of the Contract, initiated by either the Provider or the CLIENT, does not excuse the latter from its obligation to pay for the costs related to services already provided.

## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- Implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- Provision of infrastructure services,
- Additional provision of Reverseability services.

Access to these services, as well as their use, are subject to the terms and conditions established in the present Contract, including all its associated annexes.

## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain Optional Services would not have been initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the option of subscribing to them subsequently.
The provision of any Optional Service by the Provider is conditioned upon the prior consent of the parties following a concerted evaluation.

## 10. Conditions of Use for Services

### 10.1. Compliance with service conditions

The CLIENT agrees to place an order and use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable service conditions.
The use of Services must be carried out in a responsible manner. In particular, the CLIENT undertakes to familiarize themselves with the General Terms of Sale and Use (CGVU) currently in force and to respect all directives provided to them at the time of placement of order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services for third-party accounts or allows third parties access to the Services, the CLIENT is required to inform and obtain acceptance from these parties of the current usage terms beforehand. The CLIENT thereby ensures the PROVIDER that these parties comply fully with the current conditions by those concerned.

### 10.2. Selection of services

Before proceeding with the order and utilization of the Services, the CLIENT agrees to carefully examine the current Conditions of Use, as well as to thoroughly analyze the entire documentation, configurations, options, and service offerings provided, with the goal of selecting the Services and characteristics that precisely meet their needs and those of third parties using the Services on behalf of or for their account.

The CLIENT is particularly attentive to ensuring that the selected Services conform to legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities conducted via the use of the Services. For any information request related to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the PROVIDER. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed about potential changes, including upon issuance of new ORDERS.

### 10.3. Connection
Access to the Services requires that the CLIENT has, at their own expense and under their own responsibility, an adequate distant connection (such as Internet or a private network). It is noted that the Internet network can be subject to technical fluctuations and security risks that escape the measures of technical implementation by the PROVIDER within the scope of the Services.

The Service Provider shall not be liable for failures due to Internet access providers or any third-party network operator (including, but not limited to, connectivity reliability issues, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.), nor for the consequences of such failures, in particular when they lead to unavailability or interruption of Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Methods

The Customer assumes sole responsibility for managing and maintaining confidentiality of login credentials and passwords necessary for accessing and utilizing Services. It is their duty to ensure that authorized users are fully informed and adhere to best practices in security to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication means. The Customer is solely liable for consequences resulting from loss, disclosure, or unauthorized use or misuse of authentication means attributed to users.

In no event shall the Provider be liable for any such incidents. The CLIENT agrees to notify without delay the Provider in case of suspected loss or disclosure of authentication means, and to initiate immediately the procedures for replacement or reinitialization of these means.

### 10.5. Contents

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and abstains from any access to such content, unless within the strict framework necessary for the provision of Services. Therefore, the Provider does not proceed with any verification, validation or updating of the mentioned content.

Likewise, it is not responsible for dedicated backups of the content stored through the Services. It is therefore up to the CLIENT to take adequate measures for the backup of its content, in order to protect itself against any risk of loss or deterioration, whatever the reason may be, particularly via the use of suitable workstations within the Provider's catalogue.

Note: I have followed the rules strictly and translated only the text without URLs, markdown filenames with .md extension, content within square brackets [ ] and parentheses () immediately following a closing square bracket ].

The managed content must be legal and used in accordance with good practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations.

The use of illicit content (such as the dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of content that justifies crimes, incites hatred or violence against individuals due to their sex, religion, sexual orientation, or disability, or violates the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any failure to comply with these rules may result, at the discretion of the Provider, in the immediate suspension of Services, the deactivation of the CLIENT's account, even termination of the Contract exclusively at the expense of the CLIENT. Without prejudice to the Provider's right to pursue judicial action or claim damages for loss suffered.

### 10.6. Respect of Laws, Regulations and Ethical Rules

The Services must be used in a responsible manner, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative changes and regulatory updates. The following practices are explicitly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent uses of the Services and resources provided, which may compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, affecting the quality of services offered to other users;
2. attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, clandestine listening, spoofing, and any form of attack emanating from the provided resources, except for pre-authorized prior testing by the Provider;
3. all forms of spam or similar "spamming" practices; 
4. the use of illicit content or prohibited material, as described earlier in the section “Content”.

### 10.7. Suspension of Service

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or totally suspend Services in cases of:

1. real threats to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, Services, or Client data;
2. implementation of scheduled maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received pursuant to Article 6 of the Law for Trust in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violations of usage conditions established by the Contract.

Such a suspension may be immediate, without prior notice, in cases of critical situations or to prevent illicit or fraudulent use of Services, violations of third-party rights, or any act that would engage the Provider's liability.
The Provider will endeavour, within reason and except where necessary or in violation of usage conditions, to minimise the impact of any suspension on regular service. However, such suspensions do not excuse the Client from their obligation to settle outstanding amounts pursuant to the Contract. The Client remains informed of scheduled maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In case of a Client's breach of obligations, these suspensions will be made without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate the Contract or demand compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, the suspensions will not result in the deletion of the Client's data, unless they are exclusively due to the Provider's fault, in which case they will not be considered as an unavailability of services for the purposes of the service level agreements stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Evolution des services

The Provider reserves the right to make, at its discretion, any modifications to the Services, including the addition, modification or deletion of ranges, options and features, as well as improvements to their performance. The detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the Client's responsibility to remain informed of updates to the Services, which will take effect immediately for all new orders. Changes can also occur immediately in response to urgent needs, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or due to third-party product modifications.

In compliance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers", if an update leads to a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT - for example, the removal of a feature or a decrease in performance - the CLIENT has the right to terminate the relevant Service. To do this, he must send a notice of termination via registered mail with request for receipt within sixty (60) days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Use Rights

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider - including software, infrastructure, documentation, and other - remain the exclusive property of the Provider or its heirs. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive use right for these elements, strictly for the purpose of using Services and in accordance with contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is worth noting that, outside of these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for the elements and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) he chooses to use or exploit within the scope of Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, retain ownership of their content. The Provider agrees not to exploit these contents for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is obligated not to disassemble software, codes, and algorithms made available within the scope of the Services, including attempts at reverse-engineering, unless explicit legal authorization is granted allowing circumvention of this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to limitations specified in contract terms and restrictions related to CLIENT activities, the Provider guarantees that Services are commercially sellable and usable within the European Union as well as in host countries of data centers providing the Services.

It is the Client's responsibility to ensure that any use of the Services or authorization for their use by third parties outside of European borders complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Regulation (CE) No. 428/2009 of the Council of May 5, 2009, concerning control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as American regulations such as EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and ITAR (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions regulated by American law.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any orders from countries subject to commercial restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or entities in these countries or under sanction. Verifications, including solvability and potential presence of the Client on sanctions lists, such as the list of frozen assets of the Directorate-General for Public Finances, may be conducted. Following these verifications, the Provider may unilaterally terminate the contract immediately and notify the Client.

### 10.11. Third Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is essential to note that:

1. The Provider disclaims any liability regarding the Third Party Products provided in the scope of the Services.
These products may present technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Provider offers no warranty relating to these Third Party Products, including but not limited to all information and elements associated with such as software, systems, applications, etc., 
2. The use of Third Party Products by the CUSTOMER is strictly limited to the scope of Services provided. It is particularly prohibited for the CUSTOMER to decompile, 
obtain access to source codes, or reinstall the Third Party Product logics or systems on other infrastructure. 
The responsibility for using Third Party Products lies entirely with the CUSTOMER, who must ensure their appropriateness in relation to specific needs and objectives pursued, while respecting Contract terms.

### 10.12. Continuity and Irreversibility of Services

The termination of Services for any reason (such as contract cancellation, non-renewal, service interruption by the Client, violation of contract terms, etc.), along with certain update or reinstallation operations, entail the definitive and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, web sites, and other elements) that the Client has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or otherwise utilized or exploited in the context of Services, including any possible backups.

### 10.13. Intrusion Testing

The CLIENT is authorised to conduct, directly or via an external auditor specifically appointed, penetration tests on the Services provided (hereinafter referred to as "Penetration Tests"). These tests may only be conducted after all parties concerned have signed a audit agreement including the provision of the Service, namely the CLIENT, the auditor, the PROVIDER, and their subcontractors as applicable. These tests must comply with current legislation and require prior consent from users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The modalities for carrying out Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor, incorporating the obligations outlined in this article. The CLIENT undertakes to ensure compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the responsibility of the CLIENT. The Penetration Tests must not in any case:

- Targeting other infrastructure or services of the Provider and/or non-exclusive used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupting the optimal functioning of Services, infrastructures, and networks of the Provider,
- Affecting the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures provided by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is formally prohibited. The CLIENT assumes the entire responsibility for the consequences resulting from the Penetration Test, including those arising from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to perform all necessary backups prior to tests to ensure system restoration in case of incident.

It is noted that protection mechanisms against spam, DOS/DDOS, and other threats will remain active during tests, which may lead to temporary unavailability of Services. The CLIENT must inform any affected parties about this unavailability. At the end of the Penetration Test, an audit report will be written and made available to the Provider upon request or if it is pertinent (for example, in case of discovery of vulnerabilities).

This report audit, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without written authorization from the Contractor. In case of violation of established conditions, the Contractor reserves the right to suspend immediately access to Services, without prejudice to any potential damage.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge being subject to an obligation of collaboration. Consequently, they agree to communicate all information and document pertinent to facilitating the execution of the Contract, and particularly their respective obligations.

## 12. Responsibility

### 12.1. Capacity

The CLIENT and Contractor declare and guarantee, inter alia, possessing all authorizations, competencies, and knowledge (including technical), enabling them respectively to use and provide Services in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Contract.

### 12.2. Liability of the Provider

When the Contract stipulates service level agreements, penalties or credits awarded by the Provider to the Customer serve as a statutory compensation for all damage resulting from non-compliance with these agreements. Consequently, the Customer renounces any other form of demand, claim or action in this regard.

If no applicable service level agreement is present, maximum liability attributed to the Provider is limited to the total amount paid by the Customer for affected services over the preceding three (3) months prior to the request for indemnification.

**Exclusion of Liability Clause:** The liability of the Provider shall not be engaged in the following cases:

Inadequacy of services to meet the CLIENT's needs (notably taking into account the sensitivity of the data concerned);
Security incidents related to internet usage, including loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to CLIENT data or information on or from the Internet network;
Degradation of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. Client Responsibility
