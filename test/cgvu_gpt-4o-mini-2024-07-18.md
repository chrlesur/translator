## 4. Purpose  

This Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Service Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT with the defined Services, specifying the scope, execution methods of the Services, as well as the associated financial terms. The CLIENT undertakes in this contract in its own name and on its own behalf.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies an unconditional acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (CGVU), which the CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional, it is highly recommended that they seek the expertise of a specialist in information technology and networks before proceeding with the acceptance of these terms. This approach is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly with respect to the selection of the characteristics of the proposed work units and the determination of the resources necessary to meet their specific needs.

## 5. General provision

Each Party commits to not make commitments on behalf of the other Party. The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract proves to be invalid under applicable law or an irrevocable court decision, this provision will be considered as unwritten. This invalidity shall not affect the overall validity of the Contract nor the strength of the other provisions.

## 6. Ordering services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to possess a valid **CLIENT Account**. As part of the creation and management of this account, the CLIENT agrees to provide the Provider with all necessary data for the proper execution of the contract. This data includes, without limitation, email address, identity and contact information, as well as relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and updating of this information for the entire duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or managed by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT, this third party must attest and assure the Provider that they possess the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and bind them in accordance with the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT account

Before the activation of the CLIENT Account, as well as at any time during the provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include the request for supporting documents regarding the information provided. The Provider also holds the right to refuse activation or proceed with the deactivation of the CLIENT Account if the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Upon activation of their CLIENT Account by the Provider, the CLIENT acquires the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the Services requested, orders may be placed via the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing their CLIENT Account, including securing the authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered as having been made by the CLIENT themselves and entails their full and complete adherence to the terms of the Contract. The terms and timelines for making the ordered Services available vary according to the type of Service required. Certain Services will only be available after the Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. Therefore, it is the CLIENT's responsibility to verify that the conditions for the provision of Services meet their requirements.

The documents constituting the Contract complement and interpret each other coherently. Nevertheless, in the event of contradictions or discrepancies among them, precedence will be given to the documents according to the order in which they have been listed. The annexes to the Contract, detailing the Services technically, cannot contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without undermining the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the Contract

Contracts established under these General Sales and Usage Conditions (GSUC) are concluded for an indefinite duration, unless otherwise provided in the Specific Conditions that stipulate a defined duration.

The termination of the Contract is only possible in accordance with the provisions specified in the article "Termination." Prior to any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete recovery of its data that was stored under the relevant Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article related to "Data Recovery and Deletion."

The cessation of the Contract, whether initiated by the Service Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to settle the costs related to Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services specifically encompasses:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Portability services.

Access to these services, as well as their usage, is subject to the terms and conditions established in this Contract, including all its associated appendices.

## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain Optional Services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the option to subscribe to them subsequently. The provision of any Optional Service by the Service Provider is contingent upon the prior agreement of the parties following a collaborative assessment.

## 10. Conditions for Using the Services

### 10.1. Compliance with Service Conditions

The CLIENT undertakes to order and use the Services while strictly adhering to the applicable terms of use. The use of the Services must be conducted responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT commits to familiarizing itself with the currently applicable General Sales and Usage Conditions (GSUC) and to comply with all the guidelines provided to it at the time of order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, it is required, prior to any use by these parties, to inform them of and obtain their acceptance of the current terms of use. The CLIENT thereby ensures the Service Provider of the complete compliance with these conditions by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Selection of Services

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT commits to carefully review the current terms of use, as well as to thoroughly analyze all relevant documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services offered, with the aim of selecting Services and characteristics that precisely correspond to its needs and those of the third parties utilizing the Services on its behalf or for its account.

The CLIENT pays particular attention to ensuring that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities conducted through the use of the Services. For any information request related to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Service Provider. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to remain informed of any potential changes, particularly upon the issuance of new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection

Access to the Services requires that the CLIENT has, at its own expense and under its own responsibility, an adequate remote connection (such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may experience technical hazards and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Service Provider in the context of the Services.

The Service Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet access providers or any other third-party network operator (including, but not limited to, connection reliability issues, bandwidth fluctuations, service interruptions, etc.), nor for any potential repercussions of these malfunctions, especially when they lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Means

The CLIENT bears full responsibility for the management and maintenance of the confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords necessary to access and use the Services. They must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and adhere to best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, or misuse or unauthorized use of the authentication means assigned to users.

Under no circumstances shall the liability of the Provider be engaged for such incidents. The CLIENT agrees to promptly notify the Provider in case of loss or suspected disclosure of the authentication means and to immediately initiate the procedures for replacing or resetting these means.

### 10.5. Contents

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's contents and refrains from any access to these contents, except in the strict framework necessary for the provision of the Services. Thus, the Provider does not carry out any verification, validation, or updating of the mentioned contents.

Likewise, it does not ensure dedicated backup of the contents stored via the Services. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to take appropriate measures for backing up their contents to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, regardless of the reason, notably through the use of appropriate work units in the Provider's catalog.

The managed contents must be legal and used in accordance with good practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illegal contents (such as dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of contents that advocate crimes, incite hatred or violence against individuals based on their gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability, or violate the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may result, at the Provider's discretion, in the immediate suspension of the Services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even termination of the Contract at the exclusive fault of the CLIENT. This is without prejudice to the Provider's right to take legal action or claim damages for harm suffered.

### 10.6. Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Rules

The Services must be used responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this enumeration is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent uses of the Services and the resources provided, likely to compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, which may affect the quality of the Services offered to other users;
2. attempts to intrude or attack via the Services, including but not limited to port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, as well as any form of attack emanating from the resources provided, except for penetration tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. the use of illegal or prohibited contents, as described previously in the "Contents" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in case of:

1. a real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, Services, or CLIENT data;
2. implementation of planned maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violation of the terms of use established by the Contract.

This suspension may be immediate, without notice, in the event of a critical situation or to prevent illicit or fraudulent use of the Services, an infringement on third-party rights, or any act likely to incur the Provider's liability. The Provider undertakes, to the extent possible and unless in the case of legal necessity or violation of the terms of use, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from its obligation to pay the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT will remain informed of planned maintenance through a dedicated interface.

In the event of the CLIENT's failure to meet its obligations, such suspensions shall occur without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate the Contract or seek damages. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are exclusively due to a fault of the Provider, these interruptions shall not be considered as unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Evolution of Services

The Provider reserves the right to make, at its discretion, any modifications to the Services, including the addition, modification, or removal of product lines, options, features, as well as improvements to their performance. A detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to remain informed of updates to the Services, which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent necessities, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or due to modifications of third-party products.

In accordance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers," if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example, the removal of a feature or a decrease in performance — the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service. To do so, the CLIENT must send a termination notification by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within sixty (60) days following the implementation of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Right of Use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider — including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others — remain the exclusive property of the Provider or its rights holders. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right of use of these elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that, apart from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary permissions and rights for the elements and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) it chooses to use or exploit in the context of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of their content. The Provider commits not to exploit this content for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is prohibited from decompiling the software, codes, and algorithms made available in the context of the Services, including for attempts at reverse engineering, unless there is explicit legal authorization to bypass this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and the restrictions related to the CLIENT's activities, the Provider guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the CLIENT's responsibility, should they intend to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside European borders, to ensure that this use complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of May 5, 2009, concerning the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as U.S. regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and the 'ITAR' (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by U.S. legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or entities from these countries or under sanctions. Verifications, including the solvency and potential presence of the CLIENT on sanctions lists, such as the asset freeze list of the Directorate General of Treasury, may be conducted. Following these verifications, the Provider may unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract after notifying the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. the Provider disclaims all responsibility for Third-Party Products supplied as part of the Services. These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Provider offers no warranty regarding these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, any information or associated elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.,
2. the use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the framework of the Services provided. The CLIENT is particularly prohibited from decompiling, accessing source codes, or reinstalling Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures. The responsibility for the use of Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their suitability for their specific needs and intended objectives while complying with the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Continuity and Reversibility of Services

The cessation of the Services, for any reason (such as the termination of the Contract, its non-renewal, interruption of the Services by the CLIENT, violation of the terms of the Contract, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, results in the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Contents (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or otherwise used or exploited within the framework of the Services, including any potential backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or via a specifically mandated external auditor, penetration testing on the provided Services (hereinafter referred to as "Penetration Testing"). These tests may only be conducted after the signing of an audit agreement by all parties concerned with the provision of the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Provider, as well as their subcontractors if applicable. These tests must comply with current legislation and require the prior agreement of the users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The modalities for carrying out these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor, incorporating the obligations outlined in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring that the auditor adheres to these conditions, as the auditor operates under the responsibility of the CLIENT. The Penetration Tests must not in any case:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or the Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Provider's Services, infrastructures, and networks,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures provided by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into the systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising from the Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to perform all necessary backups prior to the tests to ensure the restoration of systems in the event of an incident.

It should be noted that mechanisms to protect against spam, DOS/DDOS, and others will remain active during the tests, potentially leading to a temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any party affected by this unavailability. At the conclusion of the Penetration Tests, an audit report will be drafted and made available to the Provider upon request or if deemed relevant (for example, in the case of vulnerabilities being discovered).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the written authorization of the Provider. In the event of a breach of the established conditions, the Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge that they are subject to an obligation of collaboration. Consequently, they commit to communicating any information and documents that may facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each Party declares and guarantees that it possesses the necessary authority and capacity to enter into the Contract and to fulfill the obligations incumbent upon it. The CLIENT and the Provider declare and guarantee, in particular, that they have all the permissions, skills, and knowledge (including technical) enabling them to utilize and provide the Services in accordance with the terms set forth in the Contract.

### 12.2. Provider's Liability

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, the penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as a lump-sum compensation for any harm resulting from non-compliance with these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of request, claim or action in this regard. If no service level commitment is applicable, the maximum compensation attributable to the Provider is limited to the total amounts paid by the CLIENT for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the claim for compensation.

**Disclaimer Clause:** The Provider's liability cannot be engaged in the following cases:

- Misuse of services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
- Non-performance, failure, dysfunction, or unavailability of services caused by a third party (other than the Provider's subcontractors), by the CLIENT, by a third-party product, or by negligence of the CLIENT;
- Indirect damages such as commercial harm, loss of orders, decline in business, damage to reputation, loss of profits or clients, particularly due to accidental disclosure of confidential information, legal action from a third party, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or inappropriate or fraudulent use of user access credentials, attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to the services or temporary or permanent interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Terms of Use," including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, to the extent that the Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT's business continuity, including backups;
- Unsuitability of the services to the CLIENT's needs (particularly with regard to the sensitivity of the data concerned);

- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. CLIENT's Liability

The CLIENT is fully responsible for the risks associated with its activities, including the use of Services provided by the Supplier and full compliance with the terms of the Contract. This liability extends to cases where the Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

More specifically, the CLIENT is responsible for:

- ensuring that the selected Services meet its requirements and those of any third party using them on its behalf;
- the management of Contents - information, data, files, systems, applications, software, websites, etc., that it reproduces, hosts, installs, collects, transmits, disseminates, publishes, or otherwise uses within the framework of the Services. This includes control, validation, updating, deletion, backup of Contents, and the implementation of measures to prevent their loss or alteration, even when these contents belong to third parties or are managed on their behalf;
- complying with applicable laws, regulations, and any relevant code of ethics;
- respecting PGSSI-S (general policy on the security of health information systems) if the service subject to this contract concerns health data, in accordance with requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS reference framework.

When the CLIENT uses the Services for professional purposes or acts on behalf of third parties, it undertakes to take out civil liability insurance with a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages that may be attributed to it. It also commits to maintaining this insurance, or any other insurance providing equivalent coverage, active throughout the duration of the Contract.

### 12.4. Guarantee

Each Party commits to conducting its activities in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The CLIENT releases the Supplier from any liability and undertakes to protect it against any consequences arising from:

- the use or exploitation of illegal Contents via the Services;
- fraudulent or non-compliant use of the Services;
- exploitation of the Services violating the rights of third parties;
- the choice of Services unsuitable for the needs of the CLIENT or those of third parties;
- the loss, unauthorized or fraudulent use of User identifiers.

The CLIENT also pledges to actively participate in the management of any request, claim, or legal action involving the Contents or the terms of the Contract, including those arising from administrative or judicial authorities, and undertakes to indemnify the Supplier for all resulting damages, including any penalties, as well as justified defense costs.

### 12.5. Third Parties

In the context of this Contract, the Supplier assumes no obligation regarding third parties, including Users, and no clause shall be interpreted as granting beneficiary rights to third parties. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for its interactions with third parties, especially with Users of the Services, and commits to indemnifying the Supplier for any requests, claims, or actions by third parties that could call into question the quality or compliance of the Services provided by the Supplier.

The CLIENT also undertakes to inform the Supplier, in writing and as soon as possible, of any requests, claims, or actions by third parties regarding the Supplier's Services, providing a detailed description of the request as well as all relevant information enabling the Supplier to provide the CLIENT with responses or useful documents it holds.

## 13. Force majeure

The performance of an obligation, whatever it may be, is suspended when its execution is prevented by a case of force majeure as defined by Article 1218 of the Civil Code.

Initially, cases of force majeure will suspend the performance of the Contract. In the event of force majeure preventing the Provider from executing its Services:

- Upon the occurrence of the event constituting a case of force majeure, Cloud Tempe will contact the CLIENT to collaboratively explore solutions to ensure the resumption of Services and agree on the terms and conditions for the implementation of these solutions, which must occur no later than forty-eight (48) hours following the date of the occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure;
- If the duration of the latter exceeds thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the event constituting the case of force majeure, or if the Parties fail to agree on a replacement solution no later than the expiration of this same period, the CLIENT may then assign the Services, subject to the Contract, to another Provider of its choice, thereby initiating the Reversibility Phase to the extent that the nature, severity, and impact of the case of force majeure permit;
- Conversely, if the Provider is able to perform its obligations normally within a period of fewer than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure, with the case of force majeure having ceased, the Contract will resume its normal execution.

If the case of force majeure persists beyond thirty (30) calendar days, either party may terminate the Contract by sending a registered letter to the other party.

All costs related to the implementation of the aforementioned solutions will be borne by the Party affected by the case of force majeure.

## 14. Financial Conditions

### 14.1. Applicable Rates

The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time the invoice is issued, in accordance with the conditions agreed upon at the signing of the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers various pricing grids for its Services, which may include, as applicable, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing modality. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that best suits them at the time of placing their order.

The prices mentioned are exclusive of taxes for Services intended for professionals, meaning that VAT and any other relevant tax (excluding taxes on the Provider's income) are added to the invoiced amount. This additional taxation does not constitute a modification of the price within the meaning of the article dedicated to the revision conditions of rates.

Unless a specific pricing is stated, the cost of Services also includes the fees related to obtaining the licenses and rights to use the tools, software, and operating systems employed by the Provider or, where applicable, made available to the CLIENT as part of the Services. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to obtain and pay for any licenses or rights necessary for the operation of the content they utilize through the Services.

The pricing structure for the Services and the units of measurement used for calculating these prices are available on the Provider's website. It is recommended that the CLIENT consult this information before confirming their order. Any commenced unit of measurement is payable in full, even if not fully consumed. Additionally, certain Services may incur additional costs for their installation or commissioning.

### 14.2. Price Change

The Provider reserves the right to revise its rates at its discretion. Any price modification will apply immediately to Orders placed after this modification. For Services already subscribed, any price increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with a thirty (30) calendar day notice via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the option, for a period of thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the affected Services without incurring penalties. This termination may be executed either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or via a specific form available in the CLIENT Management Interface. In the absence of termination within this period, the CLIENT will be deemed to have accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option for termination without penalties is not offered in situations where the price increase arises from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by Article 1195 of the Civil Code. In such circumstances, the terms specified in that article will apply.

### 14.3. Invoicing

Invoicing for the Services is carried out based on actual usage and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Provider's information system, which is considered reliable and authoritative in the event of a dispute with the CLIENT. The invoicing frequency (monthly, annually, or according to another periodicity) as well as the timing (upon order or after delivery) vary depending on the Service concerned. The invoicing terms are determined in accordance with the technical and commercial offer validated by the CLIENT and the Provider. Any commenced period is due pro rata to the period. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to familiarize themselves with these conditions before proceeding with an order. Following the settlement of each invoice, the Provider sends the CLIENT proof of payment.

The CLIENT explicitly agrees to receive invoices electronically, which are sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to retain a copy of each invoice received, in accordance with the current legal requirements.

### 14.4. Default and Late Payment

Unless there is a bona fide dispute by the CLIENT regarding all or part of the invoice, in the event of a default or delay in payment, including partial payment, the following consequences will apply:

1. late penalties will be immediately due from the day after the due date, calculated based on an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. any delay or default in payment (even partial) of the amounts owed by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting more than seven (7) calendar days after sending a notification of payment default by email, will automatically entail without further notification or formality:

- the immediate maturity of all amounts remaining owed by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the method of payment initially agreed,
- the right for the Provider to immediately suspend, without prior notice, all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid), refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and proceed with unilateral termination of the Contract, in full or in part, by email.

Additionally, in the event of a late or default payment, professional clients are required to pay a flat fee of forty (40) euros for recovery costs, without prejudice to the right of the Provider to demand additional compensation, upon presentation of supporting documents, if the incurred recovery costs exceed this flat amount.

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute relating to billing or the specifications of the Services must be submitted to the CLIENT Service of the Provider via the CLIENT management interface, within a maximum period of one (1) month following the date of issuance of the invoice. After this period, the CLIENT remains, despite any potential future dispute regarding the invoice, obligated to pay the amounts owed in accordance with the terms of the Contract. In the event that a billing error is identified, the Provider reserves the right to make the necessary adjustments to the concerned invoices, in compliance with the applicable statutes of limitations.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

Failure to comply with the Service Levels referred to in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement grants the CLIENT the right to impose penalties. The imposition of penalties will be requested by the CLIENT via email within a maximum period of 90 (ninety) days after the triggering event. In the event of a breach that is not the responsibility of the Provider, but rather that of the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalty shall be applicable to the Provider.

Penalties will be calculated with respect to the unmet reference indicator. In any case, the total amount of monthly penalties may not exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the concerned Services amount in the invoice for the month. When the CLIENT requests the imposition of penalties, the payment of these penalties by the Provider shall constitute a lump sum and final compensation for damages concerning the incidents leading to the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of Penalties

**Penalties = Percentage difference between the availability promised by SLA of the Service considered over the calculation period and the observed availability of the service considered over the calculation period.**

_**Example: Non-compliance with SLAs 1 – 3 and 4**_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to be applied **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month's rate 80%; penalty rate to be applied **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet Access 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to be applied **9.9%**_

In any case, all penalties under these General Conditions of Sale and Use may not exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the concerned services amount in the invoice for the month. Furthermore, penalties always constitute a lump sum and definitive compensation for damages concerning the incidents that led to the penalties, as these penalties have a liberatory character.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit against the Regular Service amount in the following month. If any penalties remain due at the end of the Contract, for any reason, the Provider will pay the outstanding balance to the CLIENT via bank transfer.

## 16. Termination

### 16.1. Termination for Convenience

The CLIENT is authorized to terminate the Contract without having to justify its decision or incur penalties, once a period of one (1) month has elapsed following the activation of the Contract. To do so, it must notify its termination by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Provider.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. The termination takes effect at the end of this period. The services provided by the Supplier until the effective termination date will be billed in accordance with the terms of the Contract, without any additional compensation. However, the CLIENT remains obliged to pay the remaining amounts due for the entire duration of the Contract, including for the equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination for Breach

In the event of non-compliance by either party with its essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party shall send the defaulting party a formal notice by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, granting a period of thirty (30) working days from receipt of the notification to rectify the situation.

If, after this period, the at-fault party has not corrected its breach, the aggrieved party is entitled to proceed with the termination of the Contract by sending a new notification by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation being paid to the defaulting party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the harm suffered.

The decision to terminate the Contract for breach engages the liability of the party initiating this action. In the event that it is established that the party targeted by the termination has not, in fact, failed to meet its commitments, the party that initiated the termination process shall be liable to compensate the damages incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination Without Fault

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation under the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In the event of the other party’s bankruptcy filing, unless the judicial administrator opts for the continuation of the Contract within the legal timeframe.
2. If a change of control occurs with the other party, in accordance with Article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in its direct or indirect possession by a competitor of the party invoking the termination.
3. The non-performance of the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to a case of force majeure.
4. A change in unforeseen circumstances at the time of signing the Contract, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. The repeated and abusive use by the CLIENT of the baseless liability clause, placing the Supplier in a financially harmful situation or rendering the Contract unprofitable.

Upon expiration or for any other reason for termination of the Contract:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the reversibility phase according to the terms described in the article "Reversibility";
- The Supplier is obliged to ensure the secure deletion of all data of the end CLIENT.

- This deletion involves a secure removal of all media that contained this data, in accordance with the provisions of the Service Agreement. Following the conclusion of a Contract, for whatever reason, the Supplier is also tasked with eliminating the technical data associated with the end CLIENT, including the directory, certificates, and access configuration.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include an obligation of reversibility (namely, assistance to the Client to migrate its system to another Supplier) except for providing the CLIENT with the technical interface and APIs enabling the CLIENT to back up and recover its data, including in particular the configuration data of the platforms through one of the following technical modalities at the CLIENT's choice: providing files in one or more documented and exploitable formats outside the service provided by the Supplier or through the establishment of technical interfaces allowing access to the data following a documented and exploitable schema (API).

The CLIENT, being the sole master of its System, must do everything possible to facilitate this operation as necessary (which implies, in particular, that it establishes rigorous documentation for this purpose) and the development of Reversibility plans. In the event that the CLIENT requires an additional service, the Provider may propose a consulting mission in this regard within the framework of a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 18. Confidentiality

The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, whether during negotiations or the execution of the Contract, is considered Confidential Information, regardless of its form or medium.

This includes, but is not limited to, any information relating to the Contract, as well as personal, scientific, technical, technological, commercial, social, financial, legal, or any other domain information, whether or not it is patentable. Among these pieces of information, one can notably find plans, drawings, specifications, processes, know-how, designs, methods, studies, reports, forecasts of needs, software or applications, as well as information concerning prospects, names of clients or partners.

Such Confidential Information may be transmitted directly or indirectly to the other Party, regardless of its form (oral, written), the type of documents (paper or digital), and by any means of communication. To enhance their confidentiality:

- Specific mentions will be placed on the communication supports.
- A reminder of confidentiality will be systematically performed during each exchange, indicating the date and referencing this confidentiality commitment.

However, the absence of such mentions or reminders does not in any way affect the confidential nature of the information or the confidentiality obligations of the Parties.

The confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
- Is already in the public domain without fault of the receiving Party;
- Was known to the receiving Party before disclosure by the disclosing Party, as evidenced by the records of the receiving Party;
- Is legitimately received from a third party without confidentiality restrictions;
- Is developed independently by the receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information.

Confidential Information must be strictly protected by the Parties and used solely for the execution of the Contract. The Parties undertake to:

- Use the Confidential Information exclusively within the context of the Contract;
- Limit the disclosure of Confidential Information to members of their team involved in the execution of the Contract, ensuring their commitment to maintaining confidentiality;
- Preserve the confidentiality of the content of the Contract;
- Not disclose Confidential Information to third parties without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as legally or judicially required;
- Physically protect the Confidential Information by keeping it in secure locations and taking all necessary measures for its security.

These confidentiality commitments remain in force throughout the duration of the Contract and for five (5) years after its conclusion or termination. Upon termination of the Contract, the Parties agree to return or destroy all Confidential Information, retaining no copies unless otherwise instructed by the disclosing Party.

The Provider ensures that these confidentiality principles are upheld by all its subcontractors during the Contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Provider shall comply with the mandatory provisions of Law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975, relating to subcontracting, and shall be responsible to the CLIENT for any breach of the obligations set out by said law. The use of Subcontractors shall in no way diminish the Provider's responsibility to the CLIENT under the Contract, with the Provider remaining fully accountable for the execution of the subcontracted Services vis-à-vis the CLIENT and, generally speaking, for the proper performance of the Contract.

## 20. Assignment of the Contract

The Parties agree that the Contract has been concluded intuitu personae. Therefore, neither Party shall assign the Contract, in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, particularly in the event of a change of control (as defined in Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial asset contribution. Notwithstanding the above, each Party is permitted to assign or transfer the Contract within its group, provided that it informs the other Party at least 30 days prior to the assignment or transfer operation.

## 21. Labor Law Regulations

The Provider declares that it complies with the provisions of Articles L. 8211-1, L. 8221-1 and subsequent, L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4, as well as the provisions of Articles L. 8251-1 and subsequent of the Labor Code, regarding the individuals it employs.

The Provider also commits to apply these obligations to all of its subcontractors involved during the term of the contract.

In particular, the Provider and its subcontractors shall ensure compliance with the stipulations of Decree No. 92-158 of February 20, 1992, setting forth specific hygiene and safety requirements applicable to work performed in an establishment by an external company (Art. R. 4511-1 to R. 4515-11 of the Labor Code).

The Parties shall keep each other informed of any potential difficulties in this regard and the means to address them. The Contract excludes any notion of personnel availability as part of the regulations on temporary work.

The Provider's personnel remains, in all circumstances, under the exclusive permanent legal subordination of the Provider, who holds sole authority for direction and control over its employees. The CLIENT may not give orders directly to the Provider's personnel and/or the personnel of any potential subcontractors of the Provider.

The Provider assumes responsibility for the affiliation of its personnel with all social organizations as well as its full responsibility regarding labor legislation. In this respect, the Provider certifies to have completed the declarations required by social protection agencies and not to engage in hidden labor as defined in Articles L. 8221-3 and 5 of the Labor Code. In the event that the Provider resorts to a subcontractor, it commits to ensuring that this subcontractor strictly complies with the aforementioned legal stipulations.

In accordance with legal provisions regarding the prevention and repression of hidden labor, the Provider commits to providing the CLIENT on the date of signature of the Contract and every six (6) months until the end of its execution:

- A sworn statement of submission to the tax administration, at the date of the statement, of all mandatory tax declarations and the receipt of the declaration submission;

- Absolute prohibition on the employment of minor workers, forced labor, or any form of compulsory labor, in alignment with the guidelines of the International Labor Organization (ILO);
- Elimination of any discrimination, whether based on gender, race, color, social origin, religion, political opinion, membership in a national minority, or any other condition, in accordance with applicable legal provisions;
- Fighting against corruption in all its forms, ensuring total integrity and transparency in all operations.

The Service Provider is firmly committed to honoring and promoting the fundamental values of the European Union, such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, 
the rule of law, as well as human rights including those of minorities. This commitment is manifested through vigilance and constant action to ensure 
that these principles are respected at all levels of their activity.

## 23. Intellectual Property

This Contract does not constitute in any way a transfer or assignment of intellectual and/or industrial property rights, including patents. The CLIENT is expressly prohibited from:

- Copying or reproducing in any manner whatsoever the elements used for the provision of services, including but not limited to computer code, texts, images, designs, graphic charters, ergonomics, documentation, etc.
- Attempting to decompose, disassemble, or apply any form of reverse engineering to the Service Provider's proprietary technologies.

Notwithstanding these restrictions, the Service Provider grants the CLIENT a personal, non-transferable, and non-exclusive right to use said elements, solely within the necessary scope for the use of the Services and for the duration thereof. This authorization for use automatically expires with the completion of the service provision.

## 24. Non-Solicitation of Personnel

Unless expressly agreed in writing, each Party waives the right to engage or have directly or indirectly work any employee of the other Party during the duration of the Contract, extended by a period of one (1) year from its termination date.

Any violation by either Party of the above obligation automatically entails the payment by the offending Party of a flat-rate and liberating indemnity set at twelve (12) months' gross salary (fixed and variable) of the concerned employee.

The average salary reference for calculating the amount of the indemnity is that of the three months preceding the termination date of the employment contract.

## 25. Distinctive Signs of the Parties

Each Party refrains from any action and any act that may directly or indirectly harm the distinctive signs of the other Party, and in particular its trademarks. Without prejudice to the Service Provider citing the CLIENT as a reference and the CLIENT mentioning that it uses the Services of the Service Provider. However, each Party, without the need to justify, may notify the other Party not to cite them anymore.

## 26. Personal Data

The CLIENT commits to respect, within the framework of these T&Cs, the data protection policy of the Service Provider. 
The CLIENT may request this policy at the following address dpo@cloud-temple.fr.
