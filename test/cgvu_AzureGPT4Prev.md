## 2. Preamble
The General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (hereinafter referred to by the acronym "GTCSU"), together with the annex entitled Service Agreement, constitute a contract (hereinafter the "**Contract**") established between Cloud Temple, a Simplified Joint Stock Company governed by French law, with a share capital of 13,425,850 euros, registered with the Nanterre Trade and Companies Register under number 825 400 336, whose registered office is located at *Belvédère 1 – 7 Valmy Spaces course, 92800 Puteaux, France* (hereinafter referred to as the "**Provider**"), and any entity, whether a natural or legal person, acting as a consumer or professional, private or public law, having subscribed to an offer to provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service in accordance with the SecNumCloud Framework (hereinafter referred to as the "**CLIENT**").

For the purposes of this Contract, the CLIENT and the Provider are respectively referred to as "Party" when mentioned separately and as "Parties" when mentioned together. It is specified that terms used with capital letters within the context of this Contract are defined in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, entitled "Definitions".

This reformulation aims to clarify and formalize the scope and stakeholders of the Contract, while respecting the conventions and precision required in legal language.

All services offered by Cloud Temple are available globally for clients who subscribe to the offers presented on their online platform, accessible at the following address: https://www.cloud-temple.com.

In the event of discrepancies between one or more provisions contained in the annexed documents, the primacy will be given to the hierarchically superior document. The most recent and officially approved version of a document prevails over all its previous versions. Thus, in the event of a divergence between one or more provisions within the same document, the later validated version will prevail.

The fact that a stipulation appearing in a lower-ranking document is not expressly mentioned in the higher-ranking document does not cause it to lose its legal value.

## 4. Purpose
This Agreement aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT with the defined Services, 
by specifying the scope of application, the terms of execution of the Services, as well as the associated financial terms. The CLIENT enters into this contract in their own name and on their own account.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies an unconditional acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTC), 
which the CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional,
they are strongly advised to seek the expertise of a specialist in computer science and networks before proceeding to accept these conditions. 
This step is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly in terms of selecting 
the characteristics of the proposed work units and determining the resources necessary to meet their specific needs.

## 5. General Provision
Each Party agrees not to make any commitments on behalf of and for the account of the other Party.
The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract is found to be invalid under applicable law or an irrevocable judicial decision, 
that provision shall be deemed unwritten. This invalidity will not affect the overall validity of the Contract nor the strength of the other provisions.

## 6. Ordering of Services
### 6.1. CLIENT Account
To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to have a valid **CLIENT Account**.
In the context of the creation and management of this account, the CLIENT commits to providing the Provider with all the necessary data 
for the proper execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to, email address, identity and contact information,
as well as relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and ongoing update of this information for the duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account would be established or administered by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT,
this third party must attest to and ensure the Provider that they hold the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and to commit them in accordance with the terms of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT Account
---
Before the activation of the CLIENT Account, as well as at any moment during the provision of services, the Service Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include the request for supporting documents that corroborate the communicated information. The Service Provider also retains the right to refuse activation or to proceed with the deactivation of the CLIENT Account in the case where the information would be deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order
---
Upon activation of their CLIENT Account by the Service Provider, the CLIENT acquires the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the requested Services, 
orders can be made via the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management of their CLIENT Account, 
including the security of associated authentication means (usernames, passwords, etc.).

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT themself, and entails their full and unreserved acceptance of the terms of the Contract.
The terms and timeframes for the provision of the ordered Services vary according to the type of Service required. Some Services will only be available after 
the Service Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to ensure that the conditions for the provision of Services meet their requirements.

The documents constituting the Contract complement each other and are interpreted in a coherent manner. However, in the event of contradiction or disparities between them, precedence 
will be given to documents according to the order in which they were listed. The Contract's annexes, which technically detail the Services, may not contradict 
the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without challenging the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the Contract

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU) are entered into for an indefinite period unless otherwise provided for in the Special Conditions which would set a fixed term.

Termination of the Contract is only possible by following the procedures specified in the "Termination" section. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete recovery of their data that was stored as part of the concerned Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article related to "Data Recovery and Deletion".

The cessation of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay for the costs associated with Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of services
The scope of services specifically includes:

- Implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to and use of these services are subject to the terms and conditions established in this Agreement, including all its associated appendices.

## 9. Optional Services

Should additional Optional Services not have been initially included in the Agreement, the CLIENT may choose to subscribe to them at a later date.
The provision of any Optional Service by the Provider is conditional upon the prior agreement of the parties following a joint assessment.

## 10. Terms of Use of Services
### 10.1. Adherence to Terms of Service
The CLIENT undertakes to place orders and to use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable terms of use.
The use of the Services must be done responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT agrees to familiarize themselves with the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (CGVU) in force and to comply with all the directions provided to them at the time of the order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, they are required, before any use by these third parties, to make them aware of and accept the current terms of use. The CLIENT thereby ensures the Provider of the complete respect of these conditions by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Choice of Services
Before proceeding with the order and the use of the Services, the CLIENT commits to carefully examining the current Terms of Use, as well as to analyzing in detail all the documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services offered, with the goal of choosing Services and characteristics that precisely match their needs and those of third parties using the Services on their behalf or for their account.

The CLIENT pays particular attention to ensuring that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities conducted through the use of the Services. For any request for information relating to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed of changes that may occur, especially when issuing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection
Access to Services requires that the CLIENT, at their own expense and under their own responsibility, have an adequate remote connection 
(such as an internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is made aware that the internet network can experience technical fluctuations 
and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Service Provider as part of the Services.

The Service Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to internet service providers or any other third-party network operators
(including, but not limited to, reliability of connections, bandwidth fluctuations, service interruptions, etc.), nor for any potential consequences of these malfunctions,
especially when they lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Means
The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management and maintenance of the confidentiality of identifiers and passwords required to access and use the Services. It must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and adhere to the best security practices to maintain the confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely responsible for any consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, or misuse or unauthorized use of the authentication means assigned to users.

Under no circumstances shall the Provider's liability be engaged for such incidents. The CLIENT undertakes to notify the Provider without delay in the event of loss or suspected disclosure of authentication means, and to immediately initiate procedures for replacing or resetting these means.

### 10.5. Contents
In accordance with the provisions provided by the Service Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's contents and refrains from any access to these contents, except within the strict framework necessary for the provision of Services. Therefore, the Service Provider does not carry out any verification, validation, or updating of the cited contents.

Similarly, the Service Provider does not ensure dedicated backup of contents stored through the Services. It is thus the CLIENT's responsibility to take suitable measures for the backup of its contents to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, for any reason, including through the use of appropriate units of work in the Service Provider's catalog.

The managed contents must be legal and used with respect for best practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illicit contents (such as the dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of contents that advocate for crimes, incite hatred or violence against individuals due to their gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, disability, or that violate others' intellectual property rights) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may lead to the immediate suspension of Services at the discretion of the Service Provider, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even the termination of the Contract, with exclusive faults attributed to the CLIENT. This is without prejudice to the Service Provider's right to initiate legal proceedings or to claim damages for suffered prejudice.

### 10.6. Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Standards
The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain vigilant to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are explicitly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. Abusive or fraudulent use of Services and resources provided, which may compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, affecting the quality of Services offered to other users;
2. Attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, as well as any form of attack emanating from the resources provided, except for penetration testing previously authorized by the Provider;
3. Any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. The use of illicit or prohibited content, as previously described in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension
The Service Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in the event of:

1. A real threat to the security or stability of the Service Provider’s systems, the Services, or the CLIENT's data;
2. Execution of planned maintenance operations;
3. Requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. Alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. Violation of the terms of use established by the Contract.

This suspension may be immediate, without notice, in the case of a critical situation or to prevent an illegal or fraudulent use of the Services, an infringement of third-party rights, or any act likely to engage the liability of the Service Provider.
The Service Provider endeavors, as far as possible and except in case of legal necessity or violation of the terms of use, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the regular service. However, such suspensions do not relieve the CLIENT of its obligation to pay the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT remains informed of planned maintenance through a dedicated interface.

In the event of the CLIENT's failure to meet its obligations, these suspensions shall be made without prejudice to the Service Provider’s right to terminate the Contract or to seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, the suspensions will not result in the deletion of the CLIENT's data. Unless they are exclusively due to a failure of the Service Provider, these interruptions shall not be considered as unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Evolution of the services
The Provider reserves the right, at its discretion, to make any changes to the Services, including adding, modifying, or 
deleting ranges, options, and features, as well as improving their performance. A detailed description of the Services 
is available on the Provider's website. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed about updates to the Services, 
which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent necessities, 
such as security risks or compliance with legal or regulatory requirements, or following changes to third-party products.

In accordance with the section "Specific Conditions for Consumers", if an update leads to a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example,
the removal of a feature or a reduction in performance — the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service. To do this, they must send a termination notice 
by registered mail with a request for acknowledgment of receipt, within a period of sixty (60) days following the application of the change.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Right of Use
All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Service Provider — including software, infrastructure, documentation, and others — remain the exclusive property of the Service Provider or its rightful claimants. The Service Provider grants CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that, beyond these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all the necessary authorizations and rights for the elements and contents (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) it chooses to use or deploy as part of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of their content. The Service Provider commits not to utilize these contents for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In compliance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is obliged not to decompile the software, codes, and algorithms made available as part of the Services, including for attempts at reverse engineering, except where explicit legal authorization allows to circumvent this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control
Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Agreement and the restrictions related to the CLIENT's own activities, the Service Provider 
guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the CLIENT's responsibility, if they intend to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside the European borders, to ensure that this use 
complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009,
concerning the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as American regulations such as the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) 
and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), given that the Service Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by American legislation.

The Service Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, 
or from natural or legal persons from those countries or under sanctions. Checks, including solvency and the possible presence of the CLIENT
on sanctions lists, such as the asset freeze list of the General Directorate of the Treasury, may be carried out. Following these checks, 
the Service Provider may terminate the contract unilaterally and immediately after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11 Third-Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. The Service Provider disclaims any responsibility for Third-Party Products provided as part of the Services.
These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, or stability problems. The Service Provider does not provide
any warranty regarding these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, any information or element associated with them, such as software, systems, applications, etc.,
2. The CLIENT's use of Third-Party Products is strictly limited to the context of the Services provided. In particular, the CLIENT is prohibited from decompiling,
accessing source codes, or reinstalling Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures.
The responsibility for using Third-Party Products rests entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure that they meet their specific needs and the intended goals,
while respecting the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Service Continuity and Reversibility

Termination of the Services, for any reason (such as the termination of the Agreement, its non-renewal, discontinuation of Services by the CLIENT, breach of the Agreement terms, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, result in the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Contents (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, distributed, published, or otherwise used or exploited in the context of the Services, including any backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Testing
The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or through a specifically mandated external auditor, penetration tests on the Services provided (hereinafter referred to as "Penetration Tests"). These tests may only be carried out after signing an audit agreement by all parties involved in the provision of the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Service Provider, and their subcontractors where appropriate. These tests must comply with current legislation and require the prior consent of users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The terms for carrying out these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and the auditor, incorporating the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT undertakes to ensure that these conditions are respected by the auditor, who acts under the responsibility of the CLIENT. The Penetration Tests must in no case:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Service Provider and/or the Service Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Services, infrastructures, and networks of the Service Provider,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Service Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into the systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising from the Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to carry out all necessary backups before the tests to ensure the restoration of the systems in the event of an incident.

Please note that protection mechanisms against spam, DOS/DDOS, and others, will remain active during the tests, possibly leading to a temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any party affected by this unavailability. At the end of the Penetration Tests, an audit report will be written and made available to the Service Provider upon request or if deemed relevant (for example, in the event of the discovery of vulnerabilities).

This audit report, its content, and all the information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the written permission of the Service Provider. In the event of a violation of the established conditions, the Service Provider reserves the right to suspend immediate access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration
The Parties acknowledge that they are subject to a duty to collaborate. Consequently, they undertake to communicate to each other any information and documents that may facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Responsibility
### 12.1. Capacity
Each Party declares and guarantees that it has the authority and capacity necessary for the conclusion of the Contract and the performance of its obligations. The CLIENT and the Service Provider declare and guarantee in particular to have all the authorizations, skills, and knowledge (in particular technical) allowing them to respectively use and provide the Services in accordance with the conditions provided for in the Contract.

### 12.2. Service Provider's Responsibility
When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, penalties or credits awarded by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as lump sum compensation for any damage arising from the failure to meet these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of request, claim, or action in this respect. Should no service level commitment be applicable, the maximum compensation chargeable to the Provider is limited to the total amounts paid by the CLIENT for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the claim for compensation.

**Limitation of Liability Clause:** The Provider's liability shall not be engaged in the following cases:

- Misuse of services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
- Non-performance, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of services due to a third party (other than the Provider's subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or CLIENT negligence;
- Indirect damages such as commercial prejudice, loss of orders, decreased business activity, damage to reputation, loss of profits or clients, notably due to accidental disclosure of confidential information, legal action by a third party, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or inappropriate or fraudulent use of user access credentials, attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or definitive interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Terms of Use," including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, to the extent that the Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT's business continuity, including backups;
- Inadequacy of services to the CLIENT's needs (particularly regarding the sensitivity of the data concerned);
- Security incidents related to the use of the internet, including in the event of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to the CLIENT's data or information on or from the internet;
- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. CLIENT'S Liability

The CLIENT is entirely responsible for the risks associated with their activities, including the use of the Services provided by the Provider and the full compliance with the terms of the Contract.
This responsibility extends to cases where the Services are used either directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

More specifically, the CLIENT is responsible for:

- ensuring that the selected Services match their requirements and those of any third party using them on their behalf;
- the management of Content - information, data, files, systems, applications, software, websites, etc., that they reproduce, host, install, collect, transmit, distribute, publish, or use in any other way as part of the Services. This includes controlling, validating, updating, deleting, backing up the Content, and implementing measures to prevent their loss or alteration, even when these contents belong to third parties or are managed on their behalf;
- complying with the current legislations, regulations, and any applicable code of ethics.
- adhering to the PGSSI-S (General Policy for Health Information System Security) if the service subject to this contract involves health data, in accordance with requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS (Health Data Hosting) standard.

When the CLIENT uses the Services for professional purposes or acts on behalf of third parties, they undertake to take out civil liability insurance with a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages that could be attributed to them. They also undertake to maintain this insurance, or any other insurance providing equivalent coverage, active throughout the duration of the Contract.

### 12.4. Warranty

Each Party undertakes to carry out its activities in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The CLIENT releases 
the Service Provider from all liability and agrees to protect it against any consequence arising from:

- the use or exploitation of illicit Content via the Services;
- fraudulent or non-compliant usage of the Services according to current regulations;
- the exploitation of the Services infringing third-party rights;
- the selection of Services that are unsuitable for the CLIENT's needs or those of third parties;
- the loss, unauthorized or fraudulent use of User identifiers.

The CLIENT also promises to actively participate in the management of any request, claim, or legal action involving the Content
or the terms of the Contract, including those emanating from administrative or judicial authorities, and agrees to indemnify the Service Provider for all
resulting damages, including possible convictions, as well as justified defense costs.

### 12.5. Third Parties
Under the present Agreement, the Service Provider assumes no obligation towards third parties, including Users, and no clause 
shall be construed as granting beneficiary rights to third parties. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for their interactions with third parties, 
particularly with users of the Services, and undertakes to indemnify the Service Provider for any request, claim, or third-party action that could 
call into question the quality or compliance of the Services provided by the Service Provider. 

The CLIENT also agrees to inform the Service Provider, in writing and as soon as possible, about any request, claim, or third-party action 
concerning the Services of the Service Provider, providing a detailed description of the request along with all relevant information 
that allows the Service Provider to supply the CLIENT with the necessary response elements or useful documents it holds.

## 13. Force Majeure
The performance of any obligation is suspended when its execution is prevented by an event of force majeure as defined by article 1218 of the Civil Code.

Initially, cases of force majeure will suspend the execution of the Contract. In the event of force majeure preventing the Service Provider from performing its Services:

- As soon as the event constituting a case of force majeure occurs, Cloud Tempe will approach the CLIENT to examine together solutions that allow for the resumption of Services and to mutually agree on the terms of implementation of these solutions, which must take place no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the date of occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure;
- If the duration of this event were to exceed thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the event constituting the case of force majeure, or if the Parties fail to agree on the replacement solution at the latest by the end of this same period, the CLIENT may then entrust the Services, subject matter of the Contract, to another Service Provider of their choice, thereby initiating the Reversibility Phase to the extent that the nature, seriousness, and impact of the force majeure event allow;
- Conversely, if the Service Provider manages within a period of less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure to normally perform its obligations with the force majeure having ceased, the Contract will resume its normal execution.

If the case of force majeure persists beyond thirty (30) calendar days, either party may terminate the Contract after sending a registered letter to the other party.

All costs related to the implementation of the aforementioned solutions will be borne by the Party affected by the case of force majeure.

## 14. Financial Conditions
### 14.1. Applied Rates
The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time of the invoice issuance, in accordance with the conditions agreed upon at the signing of the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers various rate schedules for its Services, which may include, depending on the case, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing method. For a given Service offering multiple rate options, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that best suits their needs at the time of placing their order.

The prices mentioned are exclusive of taxes for Services intended for professionals, meaning that VAT and any other relevant tax (excluding income taxes on the Provider) are added to the billed amount. This additional imposition does not constitute a price change in the sense of the article dedicated to the terms of rate revision.

Unless a specific pricing is mentioned, the cost of Services also includes the expenses related to the acquisition of licenses and usage rights for the tools, software, and operating systems used by the Provider or, where applicable, made available to the CLIENT as part of the Services. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to obtain and pay for any license or usage rights necessary for the operation of content they use via the Services.

The price structure of the Services and the units of measure used to calculate these prices are available on the Provider's website. It is recommended that the CLIENT consults this information before validating their order. Any initiated unit of measure is due in its entirety, even if it is not fully consumed. Moreover, certain Services may incur additional costs for their installation or commissioning.

### 14.2. Change of Price
The Provider reserves the right to revise its pricing at its discretion. Any pricing change will apply immediately to Orders placed subsequently to this change. For Services already subscribed to, any price increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with a thirty (30) calendar days' notice via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the opportunity, for thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the concerned Services without incurring penalties. This termination can be done either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or through a specific form available in the CLIENT's Management Interface. In the absence of termination within this timeframe, the CLIENT will be considered as having accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option to terminate without penalties is not offered in situations where the price increase arises from unforeseen circumstances, as defined in Article 1195 of the Civil Code. In such circumstances, the terms specified in said article will apply.

### 14.3. Invoicing
Billing for Services is carried out based on actual usage and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Provider's information system, 
which is considered reliable and authoritative in the event of a dispute with the CLIENT. The frequency of billing (monthly, yearly, or according to another period) as well as the 
timing (at the order or after delivery) vary depending on the concerned Service. The billing terms are determined in accordance with the technical and commercial offer
validated by the CLIENT and the Provider. Any period started is due pro rata for the period. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to familiarize themselves with these conditions before proceeding with an order.
Following the settlement of each invoice, the Provider sends the CLIENT proof of payment.

The CLIENT explicitly accepts the reception of invoices electronically, which are sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT.
It is the CLIENT's responsibility to save a copy of each invoice received, in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.

### 14.4. Default and Delay of Payment


Except in case of good faith dispute by the CLIENT regarding all or part of the invoice, in the event of failure or delay in payment, including a partial payment, the following consequences shall apply:

1. Late payment penalties shall become immediately due the day after the payment due date, calculated on the basis of an interest rate equal to three times the legal interest rate,
2. Any delay or default in payment (even partial) of the amounts owed by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting more than seven (7) calendar days after sending a default payment notice by email, will automatically, without further notice or formality, result in:

   - The immediate due date of all outstanding sums owed by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the initially agreed mode of payment,
   - The right for the Service Provider to immediately and without notice suspend all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid for),
to refuse any new Orders or renewal of Services, and to proceed with the unilateral termination of the Contract, in whole or in part, by email.

In addition, in the event of a payment delay or default, professional clients are required to pay a fixed indemnity of forty (40) euros for recovery costs,
without prejudice to the right of the Service Provider to demand additional compensation, upon presentation of supporting documents, if the recovery costs incurred exceed this fixed amount.

### 14.5. Dispute


Any dispute related to billing or the specifics of the Services must be submitted to the Provider's CUSTOMER Service via the CLIENT Management Interface, 
within a maximum period of one (1) month following the date of the invoice issuance. After this period, the CLIENT remains, despite any possible future dispute of the invoice, 
obliged to pay the amounts due in accordance with the terms of the Contract. In the event that a billing error is identified, the Provider reserves 
the right to make the necessary adjustments on the concerned invoices, in accordance with the applicable limitation periods.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle
Failure to comply with the Service Levels stipulated in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement entitles the CLIENT to impose penalties.
The application of penalties must be requested by the CLIENT via email within a maximum period of 90 (ninety) days following the generating event.
In the event of a breach that is not the responsibility of the Service Provider, but of the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalties shall be applicable to the Service Provider.

Penalties will be calculated based on the non-compliant reference indicator. In any event, the total amount of monthly penalties may not exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned on the invoice for the month. When the application of penalties is requested by the CLIENT, the payment of these penalties by the Service Provider shall constitute a lump sum and final compensation for damages in respect to the incidents that gave rise to the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of penalties
**Penalties = Percentage difference between the promised availability by SLA for the considered Service over the calculation period and the observed availability of the considered service for the same period.**

_**Example: Non-compliance with SLAs 1 – 3 and 4**_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month's rate: 90%; penalty rate to be applied **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month's rate: 80%; penalty rate to be applied **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA_SNC-05 – Internet Access: 99.9%; current month's rate: 90%; penalty rate to be applied **9.9%**_
 
In any event, all penalties under these General Terms of Sale and Use shall not exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the services concerned on the invoice for the month. Furthermore, penalties shall always constitute a lump sum and final compensation for damages regarding incidents that are the cause of the penalties, these penalties being liberating in nature.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit for the Regular Service amount in the following month. Should any penalties remain due at the end of the Contract for any reason, the Provider will pay the remainder to the CLIENT by bank transfer.

## 16. Termination
### 16.1. Termination for Convenience
The CLIENT is authorized to terminate the Agreement, without having to justify their decision or incur penalties, once a period of one (1) month following the activation of the Agreement has elapsed.
To this end, they must notify their resolution by registered letter with a request for acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Service Provider.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. Termination takes effect at the end of this period. The services provided by the Service Provider up to the effective date of termination will be invoiced in accordance with the terms of the Contract, without any additional compensation. However, the CLIENT remains obligated to pay any remaining amounts due for the entire duration of the Contract, including for equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination for Breach

In the event of non-compliance by either party with their essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send a formal notice to the defaulting party 
by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, granting a period of thirty (30) business days from the receipt of the notification to correct the situation.

If, after this period, the party at fault has not remedied the breach, the aggrieved party has the right to proceed with the termination of the Contract by sending 
a new notification by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation being 
paid to the culpable party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the losses suffered.

The decision to terminate the Contract for breach incurs the liability of the party initiating this step. In the event that it is 
established that the party targeted by the termination has, in fact, not failed in its commitments, the party having initiated the termination procedure will be 
held responsible for compensating any damages incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination without Fault
---
Both parties reserve the right to terminate the Agreement without notice or compensation in the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In the event of the other party filing for bankruptcy, unless the judicial administrator opts for the continuation of the Agreement within the legal deadline.
2. If a change of control occurs in the other party, in accordance with article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in its direct or indirect possession by a competitor of the party invoking the termination.
3. The non-performance of the Agreement by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to a force majeure event.
4. A change in circumstances that were unpredictable at the time of the signing of the Agreement, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. The abusive and repeated use by the CLIENT of the liability clause without basis, placing the Provider in a prejudicial financial situation or rendering the Agreement unprofitable.

Upon expiration or for any other reason for termination of the Agreement:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the reversibility phase according to the terms described in the "Reversibility" section;
- The Provider is required to ensure the secure deletion of all the final CLIENT's data.

- This deletion involves a secure erasure of all media that have contained these data, in accordance with the provisions of the Service Convention.
Following the conclusion of an Agreement, for whatever reason, the Provider is also responsible for eliminating the technical data associated with the final CLIENT, including the directory, certificates, and the configuration of accesses.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include an obligation of reversibility (that is, assistance to the Client to enable them to migrate their system 
to another Provider) except for the provision to the CLIENT by the Provider of the technical interface and the APIs 
that allow the CLIENT to backup and retrieve their data including in particular configuration data of the platforms 
via one of the following technical modalities chosen by the CLIENT: the provision of files in one or more documented formats 
that are usable outside the service provided by the Provider, or via the establishment of technical interfaces allowing 
access to data according to a documented and usable schema (API).

The CLIENT, being solely in control of their System, must do everything necessary to facilitate this operation as needed 
(which implies, in particular, that they establish rigorous documentation to this end) and the development of Reversibility plans. In the event that the CLIENT requires additional services, the Provider may propose a 
consulting mission in this regard within the framework of a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 18. Confidentiality
The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, either during negotiations or during the performance of the Contract, is considered Confidential Information, regardless of its form or medium.

This includes, but is not limited to, any information related to the Contract, as well as personal, scientific, technical, technological, commercial, social, financial, legal, or any other kind of information, whether patentable or not. Among this information, one can notably find plans, drawings, specifications, processes, know-how, designs, methods, studies, reports, forecasts of needs, software, or applications, as well as information about prospects, customer or partner names.

These Confidential Informations may be communicated directly or indirectly to the other Party, regardless of their form (oral, written), the type of documents (paper or digital), and by any means of communication. To reinforce their confidentiality:

- Specific mentions will be added to the communication media.
- A confidentiality reminder will systematically be made during each exchange, with the date and reference to this confidentiality commitment indicated.

However, the absence of such mentions or reminders does not affect the confidential nature of the information or the Parties' confidentiality obligations.

The confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
- Is already in the public domain without the fault of the receiving Party;
- Was known to the receiving Party before being communicated by the issuer, as evidenced by the archives of the receiving Party;
- Is legitimately received from a third party without a confidentiality restriction;
- Is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information.

The Confidential Information must be strictly protected by the Parties and only used for the performance of the Contract. The Parties undertake to:

- Use the Confidential Information exclusively within the framework of the Contract;
- Limit the disclosure of Confidential Information to members of their team involved in the performance of the Contract, ensuring their commitment to maintain confidentiality;
- Preserve the confidentiality of the contents of the Contract;
- Not disclose the Confidential Information to third parties without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as required by law or judicial order;
- Physically protect the Confidential Information, by keeping it in secure locations and taking all necessary measures for its security.

These confidentiality commitments remain in force during the term of the Contract and for five (5) years after its conclusion or termination. At the end of the Contract, the Parties undertake to return or destroy all Confidential Information, without retaining a copy, except if otherwise instructed by the issuing Party.

The Service Provider ensures that these principles of confidentiality are respected by all its subcontractors during the Contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Provider must comply with the mandatory provisions of Law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975, regarding subcontracting and will be responsible towards the CLIENT for any failure to comply with the obligations set forth by said law.
The use of Subcontractors will in no way reduce the Provider's responsibility towards the CLIENT under the Contract, with the Provider remaining fully liable for the performance of the subcontracted Services with respect to the CLIENT and, more generally, for the proper execution of the Contract.

## 20. Assignment of the contract
The parties agree that the Contract was concluded intuitu personae. Therefore, neither party may assign the Contract, 
in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other party, particularly in the event of 
a change of control (as defined in articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial contribution of assets. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party is authorized to assign or transfer the Contract within its group provided that 
it informs the other Party at least 30 days prior to the assignment or transfer operation.

## 21. Regulation Concerning Labor Law

The Provider declares that it complies with the provisions of articles L. 8211-1, L. 8221-1 and following, L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4, as well as the provisions of articles L. 8251-1 and following of the Labor Code, with respect to the individuals it employs.

In particular, the Provider and its subcontractors must ensure compliance with the stipulations of Decree No. 92-158 of February 20, 1992, establishing the specific hygiene and safety requirements applicable to work performed in an establishment by an external company (art. R. 4511-1 to R. 4515-11 of the Labor Code).

The Parties will keep each other informed of any potential difficulties in this regard and ways to remedy them. The Contract is exclusive of any notion of personnel provision falling within the regulations on temporary work.

The personnel of the Provider remain in all circumstances under the exclusive permanent legal subordination of the Provider, who alone has the authority to direct and control its employees. The CLIENT may not issue direct orders to the staff of the Provider and/or to the staff of any potential subcontractors of the Provider.

The Provider is responsible for its staff's affiliation with all social security organizations and its full responsibility with respect to labor legislation. To this end, the Provider certifies that it has fulfilled the declarations required by social protection organizations and does not engage in undeclared work as defined in articles L. 8221-3 and 5 of the Labor Code. In the event the Provider resorts to a subcontractor, it commits to ensuring that the latter strictly complies with the above-mentioned legal stipulations.

In accordance with legal provisions for the prevention and repression of undeclared work, the Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT, on the date of the Contract signing and every six (6) months until the end of its execution:

- A sworn declaration of the filing with the tax administration, as of the date of the certificate, of all mandatory tax declarations and the receipt of the declaration filing;

## 22. Ethics and Social Responsibility

- An absolute prohibition on the employment of minors, forced labour, or any form of compulsory labour, in line with the directives of the International Labour Organization (ILO);
- Elimination of all forms of discrimination, whether based on gender, race, color, social origin, religion, political opinion, affiliation with a national minority, or any other condition, in accordance with the prevailing legal provisions;
- Combating corruption in all its forms, ensuring full integrity and transparency in all operations.

The Service Provider firmly commits to honor and promote the fundamental values of the European Union, such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the respect for the rule of law, and human rights including those of minorities. This commitment is reflected through constant vigilance and action to ensure that these principles are respected at all levels of their activity.

## 23. Intellectual Property
This Contract does not, under any circumstances, constitute a transfer or assignment of intellectual and/or industrial property rights, including patents. The CLIENT is expressly forbidden to:

- Copy or reproduce, in any manner whatsoever, the elements used for the provision of services, including but not limited to computer code, texts, images, designs, graphic standards, ergonomics, documentation, etc.
- Attempt to decompose, disassemble, or apply any form of reverse engineering to the proprietary technologies of the Service Provider.

Despite these restrictions, the Service Provider grants the CLIENT a personal, non-transferable, and non-exclusive right of use of said elements, solely as necessary for the use of the Services
and for the duration of the same. This usage authorization automatically expires with the end of the service provision.

## 24. Non-Solicitation of Personnel
Unless prior and written consent is obtained, each Party hereby agrees to refrain from engaging or indirectly employing any member of the other Party’s staff during the term of the Agreement and for a period of one (1) year following its termination.

Any violation of the above obligation by either Party shall automatically lead to the payment by the defaulting Party of a lump sum compensation, predetermined to be equal to twelve (12) months of the concerned staff member's gross salary (fixed and variable pay).

The average salary used as a reference to calculate the compensation amount will be based on the last three months preceding the date of the employment contract’s termination.

## 25. Distinctive Signs of the Parties
Each Party refrains from any action and deed likely to directly or indirectly affect the distinctive signs of the other Party, and in particular its trademarks.
Without prejudice to the Service Provider's right to cite the CLIENT as a reference and for the CLIENT to mention that they are using the Services of the Service Provider. However, each Party, without having to justify it, may notify the other Party to cease citing it.
