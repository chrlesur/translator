under private or public law, having subscribed to an Infrastructure-as-a-Service supply offer 
compliant with the SecNumCloud Framework (hereinafter referred to as the "**CLIENT**").

For the purposes of this Contract, the CLIENT and the Service Provider are respectively referred to as "Party" when mentioned separately and "Parties" when mentioned jointly.
It is specified that the terms used with a capital letter in this Contract are defined in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, entitled "Definitions".

In the presence of discrepancies between one or more provisions contained in the annexed documents, precedence will be given to the hierarchically superior document.
The most recent and officially approved version of a document takes precedence over all its previous versions. Thus,
in case of divergence between one or more provisions within the same document, it is the subsequently validated version that will prevail.

## 4. Purpose

The present Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Service Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT with the defined Services, specifying the scope of application, the modalities of execution of the Services, as well as the associated financial modalities. The CLIENT commits to this contract in its own name and on its own behalf.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies unconditional acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU),
which the CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates in a professional capacity,
it is strongly recommended that they seek the expertise of an IT and network specialist before proceeding with the acceptance of these terms.
This approach is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly concerning the selection
of the characteristics of the proposed work units and the determination of resources necessary to meet their specific needs.

## 5. General provision

Each Party undertakes not to make commitments in the name and on behalf of the other Party.
The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract proves to be invalid under applicable law or an irrevocable court decision,
this provision shall be considered unwritten. This invalidity will not affect the overall validity of the Contract or the force of the other provisions.

## 6. Ordering of services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to have a valid **CLIENT Account**.
As part of the creation and management of this account, the CLIENT undertakes to provide the Provider with all the data necessary for the
proper execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to, email address, identity and contact information,
as well as relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability and updating of this information for the entire duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or administered by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT,
this third party must attest and assure the Provider that they have the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and bind them in accordance with the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT account

Prior to the activation of the CLIENT Account, as well as at any time during the provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify
the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include requesting supporting documents
to support the information provided. The Provider also has the right to refuse activation or to deactivate
the CLIENT Account in the event that the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Upon activation of their CLIENT Account by the Provider, the CLIENT acquires the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the Services requested,
orders can be placed via the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The latter assumes full responsibility for the management of their CLIENT Account,
including securing the authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT themselves, and entails their full and complete adherence to the terms of the Contract.
The terms and deadlines for making the ordered Services available vary according to the type of Service required. Some Services will only be available after
the Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore incumbent upon the CLIENT to verify that the conditions for providing the Services meet their requirements.

The documents constituting the Contract complement and interpret each other coherently. Nevertheless, in case of contradiction or divergences between them, precedence
will be given to the documents in the order in which they have been enumerated. The annexes to the Contract, which technically detail the Services, cannot contradict
the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without calling into question the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Contract Duration

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU) are concluded for an indefinite period, unless otherwise stipulated
in the Specific Conditions that would provide for a fixed term.

Termination of the Contract is only possible by complying with the modalities specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure
the complete recovery of their data that was stored under the concerned Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article
relating to "Data Recovery and Deletion".

The cessation of the Contract, whether initiated by the Service Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay the costs related to the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services specifically encompasses:

- Implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- Provision of infrastructure services,
- Additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services, as well as their use, are subject to the terms and conditions established in this Contract, including all its associated annexes.

## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain optional Services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the possibility to subscribe to them subsequently.
The provision of any optional Service by the Service Provider is subject to the prior agreement of the parties following a concerted evaluation.

## 10. Conditions of Use of Services

### 10.1. Compliance with Service Conditions

The CLIENT is obligated to place orders and use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable conditions of use.
The use of Services must be done responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT undertakes to familiarize themselves with the current General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU) and to comply with all guidelines provided at the time of ordering.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, they are required, before any use
by the latter, to make them aware of and accept the current conditions of use. The CLIENT thus assures the Service Provider of the full compliance
with these conditions by the third parties concerned.

### 10.2. Choice of Services

Before proceeding with the order and use of Services, the CLIENT undertakes to carefully examine the current Conditions of Use,
as well as to analyze in detail all the documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services offered, in order to choose Services and characteristics
that precisely correspond to their needs and those of third parties using the Services in their name or on their behalf.

The CLIENT particularly ensures that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities conducted
through the use of the Services. For any request for information regarding the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Service Provider.
It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed of any changes that may occur, particularly when issuing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection
Access to the Services requires that the CLIENT has, at their own expense and under their responsibility, an adequate remote connection
(such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may experience technical issues
and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Service Provider as part of the Services.

The Service Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet Service Providers or any other third-party network operator
(including, but not limited to, connection reliability issues, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.),
nor for the potential repercussions of these malfunctions, particularly when they lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Methods

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing and maintaining the confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords necessary to access and use the Services. They must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and adhere to best practices in security to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication methods. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, or abusive or unauthorized use of authentication methods assigned to users.

Under no circumstances shall the Service Provider be held liable for such incidents. The CLIENT agrees to notify the Service Provider without delay in case of loss or suspected disclosure of authentication methods, and to immediately initiate procedures for replacing or resetting these methods.

### 10.5. Content

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Service Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and refrains from any access to this content, except within the strict framework necessary for the provision of the Services. Thus, the Service Provider does not perform any verification, validation, or update of the mentioned content.

Similarly, it does not provide dedicated backup of content stored via the Services. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to take adequate measures for backing up their content, in order to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, regardless of the reason, particularly through the use of appropriate work units in the Service Provider's catalog.

The managed content must be legal and used in compliance with good practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illicit content (such as the dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of content advocating crimes, inciting hatred or violence against individuals based on their sex, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability, or violating the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may result, at the discretion of the Service Provider, in the immediate suspension of Services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even termination of the Contract at the exclusive fault of the CLIENT. This is without prejudice to the Service Provider's right to initiate legal proceedings or claim damages for harm suffered.

### 10.6. Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Rules

The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent uses of the Services and provided resources, likely to compromise the stability and security of the Service Provider's systems, potentially affecting the quality of Services offered to other users;
2. attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, as well as any form of attack originating from the provided resources, with the exception of intrusion tests previously authorized by the Service Provider;
3. any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. the use of illicit or prohibited content, as described previously in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension

The Service Provider reserves the right to temporarily or fully suspend the Services in the event of:

1. a real threat to the security or stability of the Service Provider's systems, Services, or CLIENT data;
2. implementation of scheduled maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Trust in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violation of the terms of use established by the Contract.

This suspension may be immediate, without prior notice, in critical situations or to prevent illicit or fraudulent use of the Services,
an infringement of third-party rights, or any act likely to engage the Service Provider's liability.
The Service Provider endeavors, to the extent possible and except in cases of legal necessity or violation of the terms of use,
to minimize the impact of any suspension on regular service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from its obligation to pay
the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT remains informed of planned maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In the event of the CLIENT's failure to meet its obligations, these suspensions will be made without prejudice to the Service Provider's right to terminate
the Contract or to seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in
the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are exclusively due to a fault of the Service Provider, these interruptions will not
be considered as an unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Evolution of services

The Service Provider reserves the right to make, at its discretion, any modification to the Services, including the addition, modification or
removal of ranges, options, features, as well as the improvement of their performance. The detailed description of the Services
is available on the Service Provider's website. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed of Service updates,
which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent necessities,
such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following modifications to third-party products.

In accordance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers", if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example,
the removal of a feature or a decrease in performance — the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service. To do so, it must send a termination notice
by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within sixty (60) days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual property and right of use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Service Provider — including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others — remain the exclusive property
of the Service Provider or its rightful owners. The Service Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements,
strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that,
apart from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for the elements
and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) that it chooses to use or exploit in the context of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of their content. The Service Provider undertakes not to exploit this content
for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is required not to decompile the software,
codes and algorithms made available as part of the Services, including for reverse engineering attempts, unless explicitly legally authorized
to circumvent this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and restrictions related to the CLIENT's own activities, the Service Provider 
guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the CLIENT's responsibility, if they intend to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside European borders, to ensure that this use 
complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009, 
concerning the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as American regulations such as EAR (Export Administration Regulations) 
and 'ITAR' (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Service Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by American legislation.

The Service Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, 
or from natural or legal persons from these countries or under sanctions. Verifications, including solvency and the possible presence of the CLIENT
on sanctions lists, such as the asset freeze list of the General Directorate of the Treasury, may be carried out. Following these verifications, 
the Service Provider may terminate the contract unilaterally and immediately after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. the Service Provider disclaims all responsibility for Third-Party Products provided as part of the Services. 
These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Service Provider offers 
no warranty relating to these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc., 
2. the use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the scope of the Services provided. In particular, the CLIENT is prohibited from decompiling, 
obtaining access to source codes, or reinstalling Third-Party software Products or systems on other infrastructures. 
The responsibility for the use of Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their adequacy with their specific needs and intended objectives, 
while respecting the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Service Continuity and Reversibility

The cessation of Services, for any reason (such as termination of the Contract, its non-renewal, 
interruption of Services by the CLIENT, violation of the terms of the Contract, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, 
result in the definitive and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) 
that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or otherwise used or exploited in the context of the Services, 
including any potential backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or through a specifically mandated external auditor, penetration tests on the Services provided 
(referred to here as "Penetration Tests"). These tests can only be carried out after the signing of an audit agreement by all parties concerned
by the provision of the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Service Provider, as well as their subcontractors if applicable. 
These tests must comply with current legislation and require prior agreement from users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The terms for conducting these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor, 
incorporating the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring the auditor's compliance with these conditions, who acts under the responsibility 
of the CLIENT. The Penetration Tests must under no circumstances:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or the Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Provider's Services, infrastructures, and networks,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising from
the Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions carried out by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to perform all necessary backups 
before the tests to ensure system restoration in case of an incident.

It should be noted that protection mechanisms against spam, DOS/DDOS, and others, will remain active during the tests, potentially causing 
temporary unavailability of Services. The CLIENT must inform any party affected by this unavailability. At the end of the Penetration Tests, 
an audit report will be drafted and made available to the Provider upon request or if deemed relevant (for example, in case of vulnerability discovery).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential 
and must not be published or shared without the written authorization of the Provider. In case of violation of the established conditions, the Provider 
reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge that they are subject to an obligation of collaboration. Consequently, they commit to communicating 
any information and document that may facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each Party declares and warrants that it possesses the necessary authority and capacity to enter into the Contract and to perform its incumbent obligations. The CLIENT and the Provider specifically declare and warrant that they have all the authorizations, skills, 
and knowledge (particularly technical) enabling them to respectively use and provide the Services in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Contract.

### 12.2. Provider's Liability

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, the penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as lump-sum compensation for 
any damage resulting from the non-compliance with these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of request, claim, or action in this regard. 
If no service level commitment is applicable, the maximum compensation attributable to the Provider is limited to the total amount paid by the CLIENT 
for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the compensation request.

**Liability Exemption Clause:** The Provider's liability shall not be engaged in the following cases:

- Misuse of services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
- Non-execution, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of services due to a third party (other than the Provider's subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or negligence of the CLIENT;
- Indirect damages such as commercial loss, loss of orders, decrease in activity, damage to reputation, loss of profits or clients, particularly due to accidental disclosure of confidential information, legal action by a third party, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or inappropriate or fraudulent use of user access credentials, attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Terms of Use", including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, insofar as the Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT's business continuity, including backups;
- Inadequacy of services to the CLIENT's needs (particularly regarding the sensitivity of the data concerned);
- Security incidents related to the use of the internet, especially in case of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to data or information of the CLIENT on or from the internet network;
- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. Client's Responsibility

The CLIENT is entirely responsible for the risks associated with its activities, including the use of Services provided by the Service Provider and full compliance with the terms of the Contract.
This responsibility extends to cases where the Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

More specifically, the CLIENT is responsible for:

- ensuring that the chosen Services meet its requirements and those of any third party using them on its behalf;
- managing the Content - information, data, files, systems, applications, software, websites, etc., that it reproduces, hosts, installs, collects, transmits, disseminates,
publishes or uses in any other way within the framework of the Services. This includes controlling, validating, updating, eliminating, backing up the Content, and
implementing measures to prevent its loss or alteration, even when this content belongs to third parties or is managed on their behalf;
- complying with applicable laws, regulations, and any applicable code of ethics.
- complying with the PGSSI-S (General Policy for the Security of Health Information Systems) if the service subject to this contract concerns health data, in accordance with requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS framework.

When the CLIENT uses the Services for professional purposes or acts on behalf of third parties, it undertakes to subscribe to civil liability insurance
with a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages that could be attributed to it. It also undertakes to maintain
this insurance, or any other insurance offering equivalent coverage, active throughout the duration of the Contract.

### 12.4. Warranty

Each Party undertakes to conduct its activities in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The CLIENT releases
the Service Provider from all liability and undertakes to protect it against any consequence arising from:

- the use or exploitation of illegal Content via the Services;
- fraudulent use or use not in compliance with current regulations of the Services;
- exploitation of the Services violating the rights of third parties;
- the choice of Services unsuitable for the needs of the CLIENT or those of third parties;
- the loss, unauthorized or fraudulent use of User identifiers.

The CLIENT also promises to actively participate in the management of any request, claim, or legal action involving the Content
or the terms of the Contract, including those from administrative or judicial authorities, and undertakes to indemnify the Service Provider for all
resulting damages, including potential convictions, as well as justified defense costs.

### 12.5. Third Parties

Within the framework of this Contract, the Service Provider assumes no obligation towards third parties, including Users, and no clause
should be interpreted as granting beneficiary rights to third parties. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for its interactions with third parties,
particularly with Users of the Services, and undertakes to indemnify the Service Provider for any request, claim, or action by third parties that could
question the quality or conformity of the Services provided by the Service Provider.

The CLIENT also undertakes to inform the Service Provider, in writing and as soon as possible, of any request, claim, or action
by third parties concerning the Service Provider's Services, providing a detailed description of the request as well as all relevant information
allowing the Service Provider to provide the CLIENT with the response elements or useful documents it holds.

## 13. Force Majeure

The performance of an obligation, whatever it may be, is suspended when its execution is prevented by a case of force majeure as defined by Article 1218 of the Civil Code.

Initially, cases of force majeure will suspend the execution of the Contract. In the event of force majeure preventing the Service Provider from performing its Services:

- As soon as the event constituting a case of force majeure occurs, Cloud Tempe will approach the CLIENT to study together solutions to ensure the resumption of Services and to mutually agree on the modalities for implementing these solutions, which must take place no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the date of occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure;
- If the duration of the latter were to exceed thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the event constituting the case of force majeure, or if the Parties failed to agree on the replacement solution at the latest upon expiration of this same period, the CLIENT could then entrust the Services, subject of the Contract, to another Service Provider of its choice, thereby initiating the Reversibility Phase insofar as the nature, severity, and impact of the force majeure event allows;
- Conversely, if the Service Provider manages within a period of less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure, to normally perform its obligations, the case of force majeure having ceased, the Contract will resume its normal execution.

If the case of force majeure persists beyond thirty (30) calendar days, each party may terminate the Contract after sending a registered letter to the other party.

All costs related to the implementation of the aforementioned solutions will be borne by the Party affected by the case of force majeure.

## 14. Financial conditions

### 14.1. Applied rates

The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time of invoice issuance, in accordance with the conditions agreed upon at the signing of the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Service Provider offers various pricing structures for its Services, which may include, as applicable, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing method. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that best suits them at the time of placing their order.

The prices mentioned are exclusive of taxes for Services intended for professionals, which means that VAT and any other relevant tax (except for taxes on the Service Provider's income) are added to the invoiced amount. This additional taxation does not constitute a price modification in the sense of the article dedicated to the conditions for rate revision.

Unless a specific pricing is mentioned, the cost of Services also includes expenses related to the acquisition of licenses and rights of use for tools, software, and operating systems used by the Service Provider or, if applicable, made available to the CLIENT as part of the Services. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to obtain and pay for any license or right of use necessary for the exploitation of content they use via the Services.

The price structure of the Services and the units of measurement used to calculate these prices are available on the Service Provider's website. It is recommended that the CLIENT consult this information before validating their order. Any unit of measurement started is due in its entirety, even if it is not fully consumed. Additionally, some Services may incur additional costs for their installation or commissioning.

### 14.2. Price Change

The Service Provider reserves the right to revise its rates at its discretion. Any price modification will apply immediately to Orders placed after this modification. For Services already subscribed to, any price increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with thirty (30) calendar days' notice via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the possibility, for thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the affected Services without incurring penalties. This termination can be effected either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or via a specific form available in the CLIENT's Management Interface. In the absence of termination within this period, the CLIENT will be considered to have accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option of termination without penalties is not offered in situations where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by Article 1195 of the Civil Code. In such circumstances, the terms specified in said article will apply.

### 14.3. Billing

The billing of Services is carried out based on actual usage and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Service Provider's information system, which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of dispute with the CLIENT. The billing frequency (monthly, annual, or according to another periodicity) as well as the timing (at order or after delivery) differ depending on the Service concerned. The billing terms are determined in accordance with the technical and commercial offer validated by the CLIENT and the Service Provider. Any period started is due on a pro-rata basis. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to familiarize themselves with these conditions before proceeding with an order. Following the payment of each invoice, the Service Provider sends the CLIENT a proof of payment.

The CLIENT explicitly accepts the receipt of invoices electronically, these being sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to save a copy of each invoice received, in accordance with the legal requirements in force.

### 14.4. Default and Late Payment

Except in case of good faith dispute by the CLIENT concerning all or part of the invoice, in the event of failure or delay in payment, including partial payment, the following consequences will apply:

1. late payment penalties will be immediately due from the day following the due date, calculated on the basis of an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. any delay or failure to pay (even partial) the sums due by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting more than seven (7) calendar days after sending a notice of payment default by email, will automatically result without further notice or formality in:

- the immediate payability of all sums remaining due by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the payment method initially agreed,
- the right for the Service Provider to immediately suspend without notice all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid for), to refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and to unilaterally terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, by email.

Furthermore, in case of late or default payment, professional clients are required to pay a fixed indemnity of forty (40) euros for recovery costs, without prejudice to the right of the Service Provider to claim additional compensation, upon presentation of supporting documents, if the recovery costs incurred exceed this fixed amount.

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute relating to billing or the specifics of the Services must be submitted to the Provider's CUSTOMER Service via the CUSTOMER's Management Interface, 
within a maximum period of one (1) month following the date of issuance of the invoice. After this period, the CUSTOMER remains, despite any potential future dispute of the invoice, 
obliged to pay the amounts due in accordance with the terms of the Contract. In the event that a billing error is identified, the Provider reserves 
the right to make necessary adjustments to the invoices concerned, in compliance with applicable limitation periods.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

Failure to comply with the Service Levels outlined in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement gives the CUSTOMER the right to apply penalties.
The application of penalties will be requested by the CUSTOMER via email within a maximum period of 90 (ninety) days after the triggering event. 
In the case of a breach that is not the responsibility of the Provider, but of the CUSTOMER or a Third Party, no penalties will be applicable to the Provider.

Penalties will be calculated in relation to the non-respected reference indicator. In any case, the total amount of monthly penalties cannot 
exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned on the month's invoice. When the application of penalties is requested by the CUSTOMER, the payment 
of these penalties by the Provider will constitute a lump sum and final compensation for damages concerning the incidents giving rise to the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of penalties
 
**Penalties = Percentage difference between the availability promised by SLA of the Service considered over the calculation period and the observed availability of the service considered over the calculation period.**

_**Example: Non-compliance with SLAs 1 – 3 and 4**_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month rate 80%; penalty rate to apply **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet access 99.9%; current month rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
 
In any case, all penalties under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) 
of the amount of the services concerned on the month's invoice. Moreover, the penalties always constitute a lump sum and final compensation for damages 
concerning the incidents giving rise to the penalties, these penalties having a liberatory character.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit of the amount of the Regular Service the following month. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract 
for any reason, the Provider will pay the remainder to the CUSTOMER by bank transfer.

## 16. Termination

### 16.1. Termination for convenience

The CUSTOMER is authorized to terminate the Contract, without having to justify their decision or incur penalties, once a period of one (1) month has elapsed following the activation of the Contract. 
To do this, they must notify their resolution by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Provider.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. The termination takes effect at the end of this period. Services provided by the Service Provider until the effective date of termination will be invoiced in accordance with the terms of the Contract, without any additional compensation. However, the CLIENT remains obligated to pay the remaining amounts due for the entire duration of the Contract, including for equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination for breach

In the event of non-compliance by one of the parties with its essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send the defaulting party a formal notice by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, granting a period of thirty (30) working days from receipt of the notification to rectify the situation.

If, after this period, the party at fault has not rectified its breach, the aggrieved party is entitled to proceed with the termination of the Contract by sending a new notification by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation being paid to the defaulting party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the harm suffered.

The decision to terminate the Contract for breach engages the responsibility of the party initiating this process. In the event that it is established that the party targeted by the termination has, in fact, not failed to meet its commitments, the party that initiated the termination procedure would be required to compensate for the damages incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination without fault

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation in the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In the event of bankruptcy filing by the other party, unless the judicial administrator opts for the continuation of the Contract within the legal timeframe.
2. If a change of control occurs in the other party, in accordance with Article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in its direct or indirect possession by a competitor of the party invoking the termination.
3. The non-execution of the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to a case of force majeure.
4. An unforeseen change in circumstances at the time of signing the Contract, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. Repeated and abusive use by the CLIENT of the liability clause without foundation, placing the Service Provider in a detrimental financial situation or rendering the Contract unprofitable.

Upon expiration or for any other reason for termination of the Contract:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the reversibility phase according to the terms described in the "Reversibility" article;
- The Service Provider is required to ensure the secure deletion of all data of the end CLIENT.

- This deletion involves a secure erasure of all media that contained this data, in accordance with the provisions of the Service Agreement.
Following the conclusion of a Contract, for whatever reason, the Service Provider is also responsible for eliminating the technical data associated
with the end CLIENT, including the directory, certificates, and access configuration.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include a reversibility obligation (namely, assistance to the Client to migrate their system
to another Service Provider) with the exception of the provision to the CLIENT by the Service Provider of the technical interface and APIs
allowing the CLIENT to back up and retrieve their data including notably the configuration data of the platforms
via one of the following technical modalities at the CLIENT's choice: the provision of files following one or more
documented and exploitable formats outside the service provided by the Service Provider or via the implementation of technical interfaces allowing
access to data following a documented and exploitable schema (API).

The CLIENT, solely responsible for their System, must make every effort to facilitate this operation as needed 
(which implies, in particular, that they establish rigorous documentation for this purpose) and the development of 
Reversibility plans. In the event that the CLIENT requires additional services, the Service Provider may propose a 
consulting mission in this regard within the framework of a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 18. Confidentiality

The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, whether during negotiations or the execution of the Contract,
is considered Confidential Information, regardless of its form or medium.

This includes, but is not limited to, any information related to the Contract, as well as personal, scientific, technical, technological, 
commercial, social, financial, legal or any other domain information, whether patentable or not.
Among this information are notably plans, drawings, specifications, processes, know-how, designs, methods, studies, reports, 
needs forecasts, software or applications, as well as information concerning prospects, customer names or partners.

This Confidential Information may be transmitted directly or indirectly to the other Party, regardless of its form (oral, written), 
document type (paper or digital), and by any means of communication. To reinforce their confidentiality:

- Specific mentions will be affixed to communication media.
- A reminder of confidentiality will be systematically provided during each exchange, indicating the date and reference to this confidentiality commitment.

However, the absence of such mentions or reminders does not affect the confidential nature of the information or the Parties' confidentiality obligations.

Confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
- Is already in the public domain through no fault of the receiving Party;
- Was known to the receiving Party before communication by the sender, as evidenced by the receiving Party's archives;
- Is legitimately received from a third party without confidentiality restrictions;
- Is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information.

Confidential Information must be strictly protected by the Parties and used solely for the execution of the Contract. The Parties commit to:

- Use Confidential Information exclusively within the framework of the Contract;
- Limit the disclosure of Confidential Information to members of their team involved in the execution of the Contract, ensuring their commitment to maintaining confidentiality;
- Preserve the confidentiality of the Contract's content;
- Not disclose Confidential Information to third parties without prior written consent from the other Party, except for legal or judicial necessity;
- Physically protect Confidential Information, storing it in secure locations and taking all necessary measures for its security.

These confidentiality commitments remain in effect for the duration of the Contract and for five (5) years after its conclusion or termination.
At the end of the Contract, the Parties commit to return or destroy all Confidential Information, without retaining copies, unless otherwise instructed by the issuing Party.

The Service Provider ensures that these confidentiality principles are respected by all its subcontractors during the Contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Service Provider must comply with the mandatory provisions of Law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975, relating to subcontracting, 
and will be responsible to the CLIENT for any breach of the obligations set forth by said law.
The use of Subcontractors will in no way reduce the Service Provider's responsibility towards the CLIENT under the Contract, with the Service Provider
remaining fully responsible for the realization of subcontracted Services towards the CLIENT and, in general, for the proper execution of the Contract.

## 20. Assignment of the contract

The Parties agree that the Contract was concluded intuitu personae. Consequently, neither Party may assign the Contract, 
in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, particularly in the event of a change of control 
(within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial contribution of assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
each Party is authorized to assign or transfer the Contract within its group provided that it informs 
the other Party at least 30 days prior to the assignment or transfer operation.

## 21. Labor law regulations

The Service Provider declares that it complies with the provisions of Articles L. 8211-1, L. 8221-1 et seq., L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4, as well as the provisions of Articles L. 8251-1 et seq. of the Labor Code,

by an external company (Art. R. 4511-1 to R. 4515-11 of the Labor Code).

The Service Provider's personnel remains in all circumstances under the exclusive permanent legal subordination of the Service Provider, which alone has the power of direction and control over its employees.
The CLIENT cannot give orders directly to the Service Provider's personnel and/or to the personnel of any subcontractors of the Service Provider.

The Service Provider ensures for its personnel the responsibility of their affiliation with all social organizations as well as its full responsibility with respect to labor legislation. 
In this regard, the Service Provider certifies that it has made the declarations required by social protection organizations and does not resort to concealed labor as defined in 
Articles L. 8221-3 and 5 of the Labor Code. In the event that the Service Provider uses a subcontractor, it undertakes to ensure that the latter strictly complies with the

Despite these restrictions, the Service Provider grants the CLIENT a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive right of use on said elements, only within the framework necessary for the use of the Services
