## 4. Purpose

This Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Provider undertakes to provide the defined Services to the CLIENT, specifying the scope, the terms of execution of the Services Provided, as well as the associated financial terms. The CLIENT enters into this contract in its own name and on its own behalf.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies unconditional acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU), which the CLIENT declares to have previously reviewed, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional, it is highly recommended that they seek the expertise of a specialist in information technology and networks before proceeding with the acceptance of these terms. This step is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly concerning the selection of the characteristics of the proposed work units and the determination of the resources necessary to meet their specific needs.

## 5. General Provision

Each Party agrees not to make commitments in the name and on behalf of the other Party.
The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract is found to be invalid under the applicable legislation or an irrevocable court decision, that provision shall be deemed unwritten. This invalidity does not affect the overall validity of the Contract nor the force of the other provisions.

## 6. Ordering of Services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

In order to access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to possess a valid **CLIENT Account**. As part of the creation and management of this account, the CLIENT agrees to provide the Provider with all data necessary for the proper execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to, the email address, identity and contact information, as well as relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and updating of this information for the entire duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or administered by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT, this third party must attest and assure the Provider that they possess the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and bind them in accordance with the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT Account

Before the activation of the CLIENT Account, as well as at any time during the provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include the request for supporting documents of the communicated information. The Provider also holds the right to refuse activation or proceed with the deactivation of the CLIENT Account in cases where the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Upon activation of their CLIENT Account by the Provider, the CLIENT gains the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the requested Services, orders can be placed via the dedicated Management Interface for the CLIENT. The latter assumes full responsibility for managing their CLIENT Account, including securing the authentication means (usernames, passwords, etc.) associated with it. 

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT themselves and entails their full and complete agreement to the terms of the Contract.
The terms and delivery times of the ordered Services vary according to the type of Service required. Certain Services will only be available after the Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore incumbent upon the CLIENT to verify that the conditions of service provision meet their requirements.

The constitutive documents of the Contract complement each other and are interpreted coherently. Nevertheless, in case of contradiction or discrepancies between them, precedence will be given to the documents in the order in which they have been listed. The appendices of the Contract, which technically detail the Services, cannot contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without challenging the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the Contract

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU) are concluded for an indefinite duration, unless otherwise stipulated in the Specific Conditions that would provide for a fixed term. 

Termination of the Contract is only possible by complying with the modalities specified in the article "Termination". Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete retrieval of his data that was stored under the relevant Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article relating to the "Data Recovery and Deletion".

The cessation of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to settle the costs related to Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the order form,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services, as well as their use, are subject to the terms and conditions established in the present Contract, including all its associated appendices.

## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain Optional Services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the possibility to subscribe to them subsequently.
The provision of any Optional Service by the Provider is conditioned upon the prior agreement of the parties following a mutual assessment.

## 10. Conditions of Use of the Services

### 10.1. Compliance with Service Conditions

The CLIENT undertakes to place orders and use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable conditions of use. 
The use of the Services must be conducted responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT commits to familiarizing himself with the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU) in force and to complying with all directives provided to him at the time of ordering. 

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, he is obliged, prior to any use by them, to make them aware of and accept the current conditions of use. The CLIENT thus assures the Provider of the full compliance with these conditions by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Choice of Services

Before proceeding with the ordering and use of the Services, the CLIENT undertakes to carefully examine the current Conditions of Use, as well as to analyze in detail all the documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services offered, with the aim of selecting Services and features that correspond precisely to his needs and those of third parties using the Services on his behalf or for his account. 

The CLIENT pays particular attention to ensuring that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities carried out through the use of the Services. For any request for information regarding the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed of any modifications that may occur, especially when placing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection 
Access to the Services requires that the CLIENT has, at his own expense and under his responsibility, an adequate remote connection (such as an Internet connection or a private network). It is brought to the CLIENT's attention that the Internet network may experience technical uncertainties and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider within the framework of the Services. 

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operators (including, without limitation, connection reliability issues, bandwidth fluctuations, service interruptions, etc.), nor for the possible repercussions of these malfunctions, especially when they lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Means of Authentication

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing and maintaining the confidentiality of the usernames and passwords necessary to access and use the Services. The CLIENT must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and comply with best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, misuse, or unauthorized use of the authentication means assigned to users.

Under no circumstances shall the Provider be held liable for such incidents. The CLIENT undertakes to notify the Provider without delay in the event of loss or suspected disclosure of authentication means and to immediately initiate the procedures for replacing or resetting these means.

### 10.5. Content

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and refrains from any access to this content, except within the strict framework necessary for the provision of the Services. Thus, the Provider does not perform any verification, validation, or updating of the aforementioned content.

Similarly, it does not provide dedicated backup of the content stored via the Services. It is therefore incumbent upon the CLIENT to take appropriate measures to back up their content, in order to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, whatever the reason, notably through the use of appropriate resource units in the Provider's catalog.

The managed content must be legal and used in compliance with best practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illicit content (such as the dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of content glorifying crimes, inciting hatred or violence against individuals because of their sex, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability, or violating the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may result, at the Provider's discretion, in the immediate suspension of the Services, the deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even the termination of the Contract at the CLIENT's sole fault. This is without prejudice to the Provider's right to initiate legal proceedings or claim damages for the prejudice suffered.

### 10.6. Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Rules

The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent use of the Services and provided resources, likely to compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, which may affect the quality of Services offered to other users;

2. attempts of intrusion or attack via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, as well as any form of attack originating from the provided resources, except for intrusion tests previously authorized by the Provider;

3. any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;

4. the use of illicit or prohibited content, as described previously in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in case of:

1. real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, the Services, or CLIENT data;
2. implementation of scheduled maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violation of the conditions of use established by the Contract.

This suspension may be immediate, without prior notice, in the event of a critical situation or to prevent illicit or fraudulent use of the Services,
an infringement of third-party rights, or any act likely to engage the Provider's liability.
The Provider endeavors, insofar as possible and except in cases of legal necessity or violation of the conditions of use,
to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from their obligation to pay
the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT remains informed of planned maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In case of the CLIENT's failure to fulfill their obligations, these suspensions will be without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate
the Contract or to seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, the suspensions will not result in
the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are exclusively due to a fault of the Provider, these interruptions will not be considered
as unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Evolution of the Services

The Provider reserves the right to make, at its discretion, any modification to the Services, including the addition, modification, or
deletion of ranges, options, functionalities, as well as the improvement of their performance. The detailed description of the Services
is available on the Provider's website. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed of updates to the Services,
which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent necessities,
such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following modifications of third-party products.

In accordance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers," if an update leads to a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT—for example,
the removal of a functionality or a decrease in performance—the CLIENT has the right to terminate the concerned Service. To do so, they must send a notification
of termination by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within sixty (60) days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Right of Use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider—including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others—remain the exclusive property
of the Provider or its assigns. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements,
strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to note that,
apart from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for the elements
and contents (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) they choose to use or operate within the framework of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as their Users, remain the owners of their content. The Provider undertakes not to exploit this content
for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with the laws in force, the CLIENT is required not to decompile the software,
codes, and algorithms made available within the framework of the Services, including attempts at reverse engineering, except where explicit legal
authorization allows bypassing this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and the restrictions related to the CLIENT's own activities, the Provider guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services. 

It is incumbent upon the CLIENT, if it intends to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside European borders, to ensure that such use complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009, concerning the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as U.S. regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and the ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by U.S. legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order originating from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or entities of those countries or under sanctions. Verifications, including creditworthiness and the possible presence of the CLIENT on sanction lists, such as the asset freeze list of the General Directorate of the Treasury, may be conducted. Following these verifications, the Provider may unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. The Provider declines all responsibility regarding the Third-Party Products provided within the framework of the Services. These products may present technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Provider offers no warranty related to these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.
2. The use of the Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the framework of the Services provided. The CLIENT is notably prohibited from decompiling, obtaining access to source codes, or reinstalling the Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures. The responsibility for the use of the Third-Party Products rests entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their adequacy with its specific needs and the intended objectives, while respecting the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Continuity and Reversibility of Services

The cessation of the Services, for any reason (such as the termination of the Contract, its non-renewal, interruption of the Services by the CLIENT, violation of the terms of the Contract, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, lead to the definitive and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or in any other way used or exploited within the framework of the Services, including any possible backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or via a specifically mandated external auditor, penetration tests on the provided Services (here referred to as "Penetration Testing"). These tests can only be performed after the signing of an audit agreement by all parties concerned with the provision of the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Provider, as well as their subcontractors where applicable. These tests must comply with current legislation and require the prior agreement of users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The terms and conditions for conducting these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor, incorporating the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the CLIENT's responsibility. Under no circumstances should the Penetration Tests:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or of the Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Provider's Services, infrastructures, and networks,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising from the Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to perform all necessary backups before the tests to ensure the restoration of systems in case of an incident.

It should be noted that protection mechanisms against spam, DOS/DDOS, and others, will remain active during the tests, which may lead to temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any party impacted by this unavailability. At the end of the Penetration Tests, an audit report will be drafted and made available to the Provider upon request or if it proves relevant (for example, in case of discovery of vulnerabilities).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the Provider's written authorization. In case of violation of the established conditions, the Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge being subject to an obligation of collaboration. Consequently, they commit to communicating any information and document likely to facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, of their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each of the Parties declares and guarantees to possess the necessary authority and capacity to conclude the Contract and to perform the obligations incumbent upon them. The CLIENT and the Provider declare and guarantee, in particular, to have all authorizations, skills, and knowledge (notably technical) allowing them respectively to use and provide the Services in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Contract.

### 12.2. Liability of the Provider

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, the penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as lump-sum compensation for any damage resulting from the non-compliance with these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of demand, claim, or action in this respect. If no service level commitment is applicable, the maximum compensation chargeable to the Provider is limited to the total sums paid by the CLIENT for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the indemnification request.

**Disclaimer of Liability Clause:** The Provider's liability cannot be engaged in the following cases:

- Misuse of the services in contravention of the terms of the Contract;
- Non-performance, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of the services due to a third party (other than the Provider's subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or negligence by the CLIENT;
- Indirect damages such as commercial harm, loss of orders, decrease in activity, damage to reputation, loss of profits or clients, notably due to accidental disclosure of confidential information, legal action by a third party, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or inappropriate or fraudulent use of user access credentials, attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to the services or temporary or permanent interruption, pursuant to Article 6 "Conditions of Use", including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, insofar as the Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT's business continuity, including backups;
- Inadequacy of the services to the CLIENT's needs (notably with regard to the sensitivity of the data concerned);
- Security incidents related to the use of the Internet, notably in case of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to CLIENT data or information on or from the Internet network;
- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. Responsibility of the CLIENT

The CLIENT is fully responsible for the risks associated with its activities, including the use of the Services provided by the Provider and full compliance with the terms of the Contract. This responsibility extends to cases where the Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

More specifically, the CLIENT is responsible for:

- ensuring that the chosen Services correspond to its requirements and those of any third party using them on its behalf;
- managing the Content—information, data, files, systems, applications, software, websites, etc.—that it reproduces, hosts, installs, collects, transmits, disseminates, publishes, or uses in any other manner within the framework of the Services. This includes the control, validation, updating, deletion, backup of the Content, and the implementation of measures to prevent their loss or alteration, even when these contents belong to third parties or are managed on their behalf;
- complying with the laws and regulations in force, as well as any applicable code of ethics;
- complying with the PGSSI-S (politique générale de sécurité des systèmes d’information de santé) if the service subject to this contract involves health data, in accordance with requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS reference framework.

When the CLIENT uses the Services for professional purposes or acts on behalf of third parties, it undertakes to subscribe to civil liability insurance with a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages that could be attributed to it. It also undertakes to maintain this insurance, or any other insurance offering equivalent coverage, active throughout the duration of the Contract.

### 12.4. Warranty

Each Party undertakes to conduct its activities in strict compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. The CLIENT releases the Provider from all liability and undertakes to protect it against any consequence arising from:

- the use or exploitation of illicit Content via the Services;
- a fraudulent use or non-compliant use with the regulations in force of the Services;
- an exploitation of the Services infringing the rights of third parties;
- the choice of Services unsuited to the needs of the CLIENT or those of third parties;
- the loss, unauthorized or fraudulent use of the Users' identifiers.

The CLIENT also promises to actively participate in the management of any request, claim, or legal action involving the Content or the terms of the Contract, including those emanating from administrative or judicial authorities, and undertakes to indemnify the Provider for all resulting damages, including any judgments, as well as the justified defense costs.

### 12.5. Third Parties

Within the framework of this Contract, the Provider assumes no obligation towards third parties, including the Users, and no clause should be interpreted as granting beneficiary rights to third parties. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for its interactions with third parties, particularly with the Users of the Services, and undertakes to indemnify the Provider for any request, claim, or action by third parties that could question the quality or compliance of the Services provided by the Provider.

The CLIENT also undertakes to inform the Provider, in writing and as soon as possible, of any request, claim, or action by third parties concerning the Provider's Services, providing a detailed description of the request as well as all relevant information allowing the Provider to provide the CLIENT with the response elements or useful documents it holds.

## 13. Force Majeure

The performance of an obligation, whatever it may be, is suspended when its execution is prevented by a case of force majeure as defined by Article 1218 of the Civil Code.

In the first instance, cases of force majeure will suspend the execution of the Contract. In the event of force majeure preventing the Service Provider from performing its Services:

- Upon the occurrence of the event constituting a case of force majeure, Cloud Tempe will approach the CLIENT to jointly study solutions allowing the resumption of the Services and to agree by mutual consent on the modalities of implementing these solutions, implementation which must occur no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the date of occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure;
- If the duration of this event were to exceed thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the event constituting the case of force majeure, or if the Parties could not agree on the replacement solution at the latest upon the expiration of this same period, the CLIENT could then entrust the Services covered by the Contract to another Service Provider of their choice, thereby initiating the Reversibility Phase insofar as the nature, severity, and impact of the force majeure event permit;
- Conversely, if the Service Provider manages, within a period of less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of occurrence of the event constituting the case of force majeure, to normally perform its obligations, the force majeure event having ceased, the Contract will resume its normal execution.

If the case of force majeure persists beyond thirty (30) calendar days, each party may terminate the Contract after sending a registered letter to the other party.

All costs related to the implementation of the aforementioned solutions shall be borne by the Party affected by the case of force majeure.

## 14. Financial Conditions

### 14.1. Applied Rates

The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time of the issuance of the invoice, in accordance with the conditions agreed upon when signing the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Service Provider offers various pricing schedules for its Services, which may include, as the case may be, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing modality. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that suits them best when placing their order.

The prices mentioned are exclusive of taxes for Services intended for professionals, which means that VAT and any other relevant tax (with the exception of taxes on the Service Provider's income) are added to the invoiced amount. This additional taxation does not constitute a price modification in the sense of the article dedicated to the conditions for revising rates.

Unless a specific pricing is mentioned, the cost of the Services also includes fees related to the acquisition of licenses and usage rights for tools, software, and operating systems used by the Service Provider or, where applicable, made available to the CLIENT within the framework of the Services. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to obtain and pay for any license or usage right necessary for the exploitation of the content they use via the Services.

The pricing structure of the Services and the units of measurement used for calculating these prices are available on the Service Provider's website. It is recommended that the CLIENT consult this information before confirming their order. Any unit of measurement that has been initiated is due in its entirety, even if it is not fully consumed. Additionally, certain Services may incur additional costs for their installation or commissioning.

### 14.2. Price Change

The Provider reserves the right to revise its rates at its discretion. Any rate modification will apply immediately to Orders placed subsequent to this modification. For Services already subscribed to, any price increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with a notice of thirty (30) calendar days via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the option, during thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the affected Services without incurring penalties. This termination can be carried out either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or via a specific form available in the CLIENT's Management Interface. In the absence of termination within this period, the CLIENT will be considered as having accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option of termination without penalties is not offered in situations where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by Article 1195 of the Civil Code. Under such circumstances, the terms specified in said article will apply.

### 14.3. Billing

The billing of Services is carried out based on actual usage and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Provider's information system, which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of a dispute with the CLIENT. The billing frequency (monthly, annual, or according to another periodicity) as well as the timing (at the order or after delivery) differ depending on the Service concerned. The billing terms are determined in accordance with the technical and commercial offer validated by the CLIENT and the Provider. Any period commenced is due pro rata for the period. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to familiarize themselves with these conditions before placing an order. Following the payment of each invoice, the Provider sends the CLIENT a proof of payment.

The CLIENT explicitly agrees to receive invoices electronically, which are sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. It is incumbent upon the CLIENT to save a copy of each invoice received, in accordance with the legal requirements in force.

### 14.4. Default and Delay in Payment

Unless a good faith dispute by the CLIENT concerning all or part of the invoice, in case of default or delay in payment, including partial payment, the following consequences will apply:

1. Late payment penalties will be immediately due from the day following the due date, calculated on the basis of an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. Any delay or default in payment (even partial) of sums due by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting more than seven (7) calendar days after the sending of a payment default notification by email, will automatically, without further notification or formality:

- entail the immediate exigibility of all sums remaining due by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the initially agreed payment method,
- grant the right to the Provider to immediately and without prior notice suspend all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid for), to refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and to proceed with the unilateral termination of the Contract, in whole or in part, by email.

Furthermore, in case of delay or default in payment, professional clients are required to pay a fixed indemnity of forty (40) euros for recovery costs, without prejudice to the right of the Provider to claim additional compensation, upon presentation of supporting documents, if the recovery costs incurred exceed this fixed amount.

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute relating to billing or the specifics of the Services must be submitted to the Provider's CLIENT Service via the CLIENT's Management Interface, within a maximum period of one (1) month following the date of issue of the invoice. After this period, the CLIENT remains, despite any future possible dispute of the invoice, obliged to pay the amounts due in accordance with the terms of the Contract. In the event that a billing error is found, the Provider reserves the right to make the necessary adjustments on the invoices concerned, in compliance with the applicable prescription periods.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

The non-compliance with the Service Levels specified in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement entitles the CLIENT to apply penalties. The application of penalties shall be requested by the CLIENT by email within a maximum period of 90 (ninety) days after the generating event. In the case of a failure that is not the responsibility of the Provider, but of the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalty shall be applicable to the Provider.

Penalties will be calculated in relation to the unfulfilled reference indicator. In any event, the total amount of monthly penalties cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned on the invoice of the month. When the application of penalties is requested by the CLIENT, the payment of these penalties by the Provider shall constitute a definitive lump-sum compensation for damages regarding the incidents leading to the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of Penalties

**Penalties = Percentage difference between the availability promised by the SLA of the considered Service over the calculation period and the observed availability of the considered Service over the calculation period.**

_**Example: Non-compliance with SLAs 1 – 3 and 4**_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month's rate 80%; penalty rate to apply **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet Access: 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_

In any event, all penalties under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the services concerned on the invoice of the month. Furthermore, the penalties always constitute a definitive lump-sum compensation for damages regarding the incidents leading to the penalties, these penalties having a releasing effect.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit of the amount of the Regular Service the following month. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract for any reason whatsoever, the Provider shall pay the balance to the CLIENT by bank transfer.

## 16. Termination

### 16.1. Termination for convenience

The CLIENT is authorized to terminate the Contract, without having to justify their decision or incur penalties, once a period of one (1) month following the activation of the Contract has elapsed. To do this, they must notify their decision by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Provider.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. Termination takes effect at the end of this period. The services provided by the Provider up to the effective date of termination will be invoiced in accordance with the terms of the Contract, without any additional compensation. However, the CLIENT remains obliged to settle the remaining amounts due for the entire duration of the Contract, including for equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination for Breach

In the event of non-compliance by one of the parties with its essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party shall send the defaulting party a formal notice by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, granting a period of thirty (30) working days from receipt of the notification to rectify the situation.

If, after this period, the defaulting party has not remedied its breach, the aggrieved party is entitled to proceed with the termination of the Contract by sending a new notification by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be effected without any compensation paid to the at-fault party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the losses suffered.

The decision to terminate the Contract for breach engages the responsibility of the party initiating this action. In the event that it is established that the party targeted by the termination has, in fact, not failed in its commitments, the party that initiated the termination procedure shall be required to compensate the damages incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination without Fault

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation in the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In the event of bankruptcy filing of the other party, unless the court-appointed administrator opts for the continuation of the Contract within the legal timeframe.
2. If a change of control occurs in the other party, in accordance with Article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in its direct or indirect ownership by a competitor of the party invoking the termination.
3. The non-performance of the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to a case of force majeure.
4. An unforeseen change of circumstances at the time of signing the Contract, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. The abusive and repeated use by the CLIENT of the responsibility clause without foundation, placing the Provider in a prejudicial financial situation or rendering the Contract unprofitable.

Upon expiration or for any other reason of termination of the Contract:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the reversibility phase according to the modalities described in the article "Reversibility";
- The Provider is required to ensure the secure deletion of all data of the end CLIENT.

- This deletion involves a secure erasure of all media containing these data, in accordance with the provisions of the Service Agreement. Upon the conclusion of a Contract, whatever the reason, the Provider is also responsible for eliminating the technical data associated with the end CLIENT, including the directory, certificates, and access configuration.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include any obligation of reversibility (that is, assisting the Client to migrate their system to another Provider) except for making available to the CLIENT by the Provider the technical interface and APIs allowing the CLIENT to back up and recover their data, including notably the configuration data of the platforms via one of the following technical modalities at the choice of the CLIENT: the provision of files following one or more documented and exploitable formats outside the service provided by the Provider or by setting up technical interfaces allowing access to the data according to a documented and exploitable scheme (API).

The CLIENT, being the sole master of its System, must make every effort to facilitate this operation as necessary (which implies, in particular, that it establishes rigorous documentation for this purpose) and the development of Reversibility plans. In the event that the CLIENT requires an additional service, the Provider may offer an advisory assignment in this regard within the framework of a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 18. Confidentiality

The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, whether during negotiations or the execution of the Contract, is considered Confidential Information, regardless of its form or medium.

This includes, but is not limited to, any information relating to the Contract, as well as personal, scientific, technical, technological, commercial, social, financial, legal, or any other data, whether or not they are eligible for patent protection. Among such information are, notably, plans, drawings, specifications, processes, know-how, designs, methods, studies, reports, forecasts of needs, software or applications, as well as information concerning prospects, clients' or partners' names.

This Confidential Information may be transmitted directly or indirectly to the other Party, regardless of its form (oral, written), the type of documents (paper or digital), and by any means of communication. To reinforce its confidentiality:

- Specific mentions will be affixed on the communication media.
- A reminder of confidentiality will be systematically made during each exchange, indicating the date and referring to this confidentiality commitment.

However, the absence of such mentions or reminders does not in any way affect the confidential nature of the information nor the confidentiality obligations of the Parties.

The confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
- Is already in the public domain through no fault of the receiving Party;
- Was known to the receiving Party prior to disclosure by the disclosing Party, as evidenced by the receiving Party's records;
- Is legitimately received from a third party without confidentiality restriction;
- Is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information.

The Confidential Information must be strictly protected by the Parties and used solely for the execution of the Contract. The Parties agree to:

- Use the Confidential Information exclusively within the framework of the Contract;
- Limit the disclosure of Confidential Information to members of their team involved in the execution of the Contract, ensuring their commitment to maintain confidentiality;
- Preserve the confidentiality of the content of the Contract;
- Not disclose Confidential Information to third parties without prior written consent of the other Party, except in case of legal or judicial necessity;
- Physically protect the Confidential Information by keeping it in secure places and taking all necessary measures for its security.

These confidentiality commitments remain in force during the term of the Contract and for five (5) years after its conclusion or termination.
At the end of the Contract, the Parties agree to return or destroy all Confidential Information, without retaining any copies, unless instructed otherwise by the disclosing Party.

The Provider ensures that these confidentiality principles are respected by all its subcontractors during the Contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Provider must comply with the mandatory provisions of Law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975 relating to subcontracting, and will be liable to the CLIENT for any breach of the obligations set forth by said law.
The use of Subcontractors will in no way reduce the Provider's liability to the CLIENT under the Contract, the Provider remaining fully responsible for the delivery of the subcontracted Services to the CLIENT and, in general, for the proper execution of the Contract.

## 20. Transfer of the Contract

The Parties agree that the Contract was concluded intuitu personae. Consequently, neither Party may assign the Contract, in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, particularly in the event of a change of control (within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial contribution of assets. By way of derogation from the foregoing, each Party is authorized to assign or transfer the Contract within its group, provided that it informs the other Party at least 30 days prior to the assignment or transfer operation.  

## 21. Labor Law Regulations

The Service Provider declares that it complies with the provisions of Articles L. 8211-1, L. 8221-1 and following, L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4, as well as the provisions of Articles L. 8251-1 and following of the Labor Code, concerning the persons it employs.

The Service Provider also undertakes to apply these commitments to all its subcontractors involved during the term of the contract.

In particular, the Service Provider and its subcontractors must ensure compliance with the stipulations of Decree No. 92-158 of February 20, 1992 setting specific hygiene and safety prescriptions applicable to work carried out in an establishment by an external company (Art. R. 4511-1 to R. 4515-11 of the Labor Code). 

The Parties shall keep each other informed of any potential difficulty in this regard and the means to remedy it. The Contract excludes any notion of personnel provision falling within the scope of temporary employment regulations. 

The Service Provider's personnel remain under all circumstances under the exclusive permanent legal subordination of the Service Provider, who alone has the authority to direct and control its employees. The CLIENT cannot give orders directly to the Service Provider's personnel and/or the personnel of any subcontractors of the Service Provider. 

The Service Provider assumes for its personnel the responsibility of its affiliation with all social organizations as well as its full responsibility with respect to labor legislation. In this respect, the Service Provider certifies having made the declarations required by the social protection organizations and not resorting to undeclared work as defined in Articles L. 8221-3 and 5 of the Labor Code. In the event that the Service Provider uses a subcontractor, it undertakes to ensure that the latter strictly complies with the legal stipulations recalled above.

In accordance with legal provisions on the prevention and repression of undeclared work, the Service Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT at the date of signing the Contract and every six (6) months until the end of its execution:

- A sworn statement of filing with the tax administration, at the date of the statement, of all mandatory tax declarations and the receipt of the declaration filing;

In the context of executing this Agreement, the Parties agree to scrupulously adhere to the following ethical and legal principles:

- Absolute prohibition of the employment of underage workers, forced labor, or any form of compulsory labor, in alignment with the guidelines of the International Labour Organization (ILO);
- Elimination of all discrimination, whether based on gender, race, color, social origin, religion, political opinion, membership in a national minority, or any other condition, in accordance with the legal provisions in force;
- Combating corruption in all its forms, ensuring complete integrity and transparency in all operations.

The Service Provider is firmly committed to honoring and promoting the fundamental values of the European Union, such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, respect for the rule of law, as well as human rights including those of minorities. This commitment is reflected in constant vigilance and action to ensure that these principles are respected at all levels of their activity.

## 23. Intellectual Property

This Agreement does not in any way constitute a transfer or assignment of intellectual and/or industrial property rights, including patents. The CLIENT is expressly prohibited from:

- Copying or reproducing in any manner whatsoever the elements used for the provision of services, including but not limited to computer code, texts, images, designs, graphic charters, ergonomics, documentation, etc.
- Attempting to decompile, disassemble, or apply any form of reverse engineering to the Service Provider's proprietary technologies.

Despite these restrictions, the Service Provider grants the CLIENT a personal, non-transferable, and non-exclusive right of use on said elements, solely within the framework necessary for the use of the Services and for the duration thereof. This authorization of use automatically expires with the end of the provision of services.

## 24. Non-solicitation of Personnel

Unless prior written agreement, each of the Parties refrains from hiring or employing directly or indirectly any member of the other Party's personnel during the term of the Agreement increased by a period of one (1) year from its termination date.

Any violation by one of the Parties of the above obligation results automatically in the payment by the offending Party of a fixed and compensatory indemnity set at twelve (12) months of gross salary (fixed and variable) of the personnel member concerned.

The average reference salary for calculating the amount of compensation is that of the last 3 months preceding the date of termination of the employment contract.

## 25. Distinctive Signs of the Parties

Each Party refrains from any action or act likely to harm directly or indirectly the distinctive signs of the other Party, and in particular its trademarks. Without prejudice for the Service Provider to cite the CLIENT as a reference and for the CLIENT to mention that it uses the Service Provider's Services. However, each Party, without having to justify it, may notify the other Party to no longer cite it.
