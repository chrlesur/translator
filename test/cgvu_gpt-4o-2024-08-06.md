## 4. Purpose

This Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT with the defined Services, specifying the scope, the execution modalities of the Services, as well as the associated financial terms. The CLIENT enters into this contract in its own name and on its own behalf.

The adherence of the CLIENT to this contract implies unconditional acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU), which the CLIENT declares to have previously reviewed, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates in a professional capacity, it is strongly recommended that they seek the expertise of a specialist in information technology and networks before proceeding with the acceptance of these terms. This approach is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly in terms of selecting the features of the proposed work units and determining the resources required to meet their specific needs.

## 5. General Provision

Each Party commits not to make commitments in the name and on behalf of the other Party. The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract is found to be invalid under applicable legislation or an irrevocable court decision, this provision shall be deemed unwritten. This invalidity shall not affect the overall validity of the Contract or the force of the other provisions.

## 6. Ordering of Services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to have a valid **CLIENT Account**. As part of creating and managing this account, the CLIENT agrees to provide the Provider with all data necessary for the proper execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to, the email address, identity and contact information, and relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and updating of this information throughout the duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or managed by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT, this third party must attest and assure the Provider that they possess the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and bind them according to the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT Account

Before activation of the CLIENT Account, as well as at any time during the provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include requesting supporting documents to substantiate the information provided. The Provider also holds the right to refuse activation or deactivate the CLIENT Account in the event that the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Upon activation of their CLIENT Account by the Provider, the CLIENT acquires the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the Services requested, orders may be placed via the dedicated Management Interface for the CLIENT. The latter assumes full responsibility for managing their CLIENT Account, including securing authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT themselves, and entails their full and complete adherence to the terms of the Contract. The modalities and timelines for the provision of the ordered Services vary according to the type of Service required. Some Services will only be available after the Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore incumbent upon the CLIENT to verify that the conditions for the provision of the Services meet their requirements.

The documents constituting the Contract complement and are interpreted coherently. Nonetheless, in the event of contradiction or differences between them, priority will be given to the documents in the order in which they have been listed. The Contract's annexes, which technically detail the Services, shall not contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without undermining the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Contract Duration

The contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU) are concluded for an indefinite duration, unless otherwise stipulated in the Special Terms and Conditions which would provide for a fixed duration.

The termination of the Contract is only possible by complying with the modalities specified in the article "Termination." Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete recovery of their data which was stored under the relevant Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article related to "Retrieval and Deletion of Data."

The termination of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to settle the costs related to the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services, as well as their utilization, are subject to the terms and conditions established in this Contract, including all its associated appendices.

## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain Optional Services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the possibility to subscribe to them later. The provision of any Optional Service by the Provider is conditioned on the prior agreement of the parties following a joint assessment.

## 10. Conditions of Use of Services

### 10.1. Compliance with Service Conditions

The CLIENT commits to placing orders and using the Services in strict compliance with the applicable terms of use. The use of the Services must be conducted responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT agrees to familiarize themselves with the current General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU) and to adhere to any guidelines provided at the time of the order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, it is incumbent upon them, before any use by these third parties, to inform them of and have them accept the current terms of use. The CLIENT thereby assures the Provider of the full compliance of these conditions by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Service Selection

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT commits to thoroughly reviewing the current Conditions of Use, as well as to analyzing in detail all the proposed documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services, in order to select Services and characteristics that precisely match their needs and those of the third parties using the Services on their behalf or for their account.

The CLIENT particularly ensures that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent in the activities carried out through the use of the Services. For any information request related to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed of any modifications that may occur, especially when placing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection

Access to the Services requires the CLIENT to have, at their own expense and responsibility, an adequate remote connection (such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may undergo technical uncertainties and present security risks that go beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider within the framework of the Services.

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operators (including, but not limited to, reliability issues of connections, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.), nor for the potential repercussions of these malfunctions, particularly when they lead to an unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Means

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing and maintaining the confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords necessary to access and use the Services. The CLIENT must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and comply with the best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, or unauthorized or improper use of the authentication means assigned to users.

Under no circumstances shall the Provider be held liable for such incidents. The CLIENT undertakes to notify the Provider without delay in case of loss or suspected disclosure of the authentication means, and to immediately initiate the procedures for replacing or resetting these means.

### 10.5. Content

In compliance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and refrains from any access to this content, except strictly necessary within the framework of the provision of Services. Thus, the Provider does not perform any verification, validation, or updating of the mentioned content.

Similarly, it does not ensure dedicated backup of content stored via the Services. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the CLIENT to take appropriate measures for the backup of their content, to protect against any risk of loss or damage, irrespective of the reason, notably through the use of the appropriate work units in the Provider's catalog.

The content managed must be legal and used in compliance with good practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illicit content (such as distribution, publication, storage, or transmission of content promoting crimes, inciting hatred or violence against individuals based on their gender, religion, sexual orientation, or identity, or disability, or violating the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may result, at the Provider's discretion, in the immediate suspension of the Services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even termination of the Contract at the exclusive fault of the CLIENT. This is without prejudice to the Provider's right to initiate legal proceedings or to claim damages for any harm suffered.

### 10.6. Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Rules

The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain vigilant to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent use of the Services and the resources provided, likely to compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, potentially affecting the quality of Services offered to other users;
2. attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services, including but not limited to port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, as well as any form of attack originating from the resources provided, except for intrusion tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. the use of illicit or prohibited content, as previously described in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension

The Service Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in the event of:

1. a real threat to the security or stability of the Service Provider's systems, the Services, or CLIENT data;
2. implementation of scheduled maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law on Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violation of the terms of use established by the Contract.

This suspension may be immediate, without notice, in the event of a critical situation or to prevent illicit or fraudulent use of the Services, an infringement on third-party rights, or any act likely to engage the responsibility of the Service Provider. The Service Provider strives, as far as possible and except in cases of legal necessity or violation of the terms of use, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from their obligation to pay the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT is kept informed of scheduled maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In the event of the CLIENT's failure to meet their obligations, these suspensions will be without prejudice to the Service Provider's right to terminate the Contract or seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are exclusively due to a fault of the Service Provider, these interruptions will not be considered as unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Service evolution

The Service Provider reserves the right to make, at its discretion, any modification to the Services, including the addition, modification, or deletion of ranges, options, features, as well as the improvement of their performance. The detailed description of the Services is available on the Service Provider's website. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed of the updates to the Services, which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent necessities, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following modifications of third-party products.

In accordance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers," if an update results in the degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT—for example, the deletion of a feature or a decrease in performance—the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service. To do so, they must send a termination notice by registered mail with a request for acknowledgment of receipt within sixty (60) days following the implementation of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual property and right of use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Service Provider—including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others—remain the exclusive property of the Service Provider or its assignees. The Service Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right of use of these elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that, apart from these provided elements, the CLIENT is fully responsible for obtaining all necessary permissions and rights for the elements and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) they choose to use or exploit within the framework of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as their Users, remain the owners of their content. The Service Provider agrees not to exploit this content for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is prohibited from decompiling the software, codes, and algorithms made available in the context of the Services, including attempts at reverse engineering, unless explicit legal authorization allows circumventing this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Agreement and constraints related to the CLIENT's specific activities, the Provider guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the CLIENT's responsibility, if intending to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside European boundaries, to ensure that this use complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of the Council of May 5, 2009, concerning the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as U.S. regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and the ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by U.S. law.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any orders from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or entities from these countries or under sanctions. Verifications, including creditworthiness and the possible presence of the CLIENT on sanction lists, such as the General Directorate of the Treasury's asset freeze list, may be conducted. Following these verifications, the Provider may unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. the Provider disclaims all liability related to Third-Party Products provided within the framework of the Services. These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Provider offers no warranties related to these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.
2. the use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the scope of the Services provided. Specifically, it is prohibited for the CLIENT to decompile, obtain access to source codes, or reinstall Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures. The responsibility for using Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their suitability for specific needs and objectives while complying with the terms of the Agreement.

### 10.12. Continuity and Reversibility of Services

The termination of the Services, for any reason (such as termination of the Agreement, its non-renewal, interruption of the Services by the CLIENT, violation of the Agreement terms, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, results in the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, broadcasted, published, or otherwise used or exploited within the framework of the Services, including any possible backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or via a specifically mandated external auditor, penetration tests on the provided Services (referred to here as “Penetration Tests”). These tests may only be performed after signing an audit agreement by all parties concerned with the provision of the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Provider, as well as their subcontractors if applicable. These tests must comply with current legislation and require the prior agreement of users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The terms for conducting these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor, recapitulating the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the responsibility of the CLIENT. The Penetration Tests must not under any circumstances:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or the Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Provider’s Services, infrastructures, and networks,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures provided by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising from the Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions carried out by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT’s responsibility to perform all necessary backups before the tests to ensure the restoration of systems in the event of an incident.

It should be noted that protection mechanisms against spam, DOS/DDOS, and others will remain active during the tests, possibly leading to temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any impacted party of this unavailability. At the end of the Penetration Tests, an audit report will be drafted and made available to the Provider upon request or if deemed pertinent (for example, in case of discovery of vulnerabilities).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the Provider's written authorization. In the event of a breach of the established conditions, the Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge that they are subject to a collaboration obligation. Consequently, they commit to communicating any information and document likely to facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each of the Parties declares and guarantees possessing the authority and capacity necessary for the conclusion of the Contract and to perform the obligations incumbent upon them. The CLIENT and the Provider declare and guarantee in particular having all the authorizations, skills, and knowledge (including technical), allowing them respectively to use and provide the Services in accordance with the terms provided in the Contract.

### 12.2. Liability of the Provider

When the Contract stipulates commitments regarding service levels, penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as lump-sum compensation for any harm arising from non-compliance with these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of request, claim, or action in this respect. If no service level commitment is applicable, the maximum compensation attributable to the Provider is limited to the total sums paid by the CLIENT for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the indemnification request.

**Disclaimer of Liability:** The Provider’s liability cannot be engaged in the following cases:

- Improper use of the services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
- Non-performance, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of services due to a third party (other than the Provider’s subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or negligence of the CLIENT;
- Indirect damages such as business interruption, loss of orders, business decline, damage to reputation, loss of profits or clients, especially due to an accidental disclosure of confidential information, a legal action brought by a third party, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or inappropriate or fraudulent use of user access credentials attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Terms of Use," including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, insofar as the Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT’s business continuity, including backups;
- Inadequacy of services to the CLIENT’s needs (particularly with regard to the sensitivity of the concerned data);
- Security incidents related to the use of the internet, notably in the event of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to CLIENT’s data or information on or from the Internet network;
- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. CLIENT Responsibility

The CLIENT is fully responsible for the risks associated with their activities, including the use of the Services provided by the Provider and full compliance with the terms of the Contract. This responsibility extends to cases where the Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

Specifically, the CLIENT is responsible for:

- ensuring that the Services chosen meet their requirements and those of any third parties using them on their behalf; 
- managing the Contents - information, data, files, systems, applications, software, websites, etc., that they reproduce, host, install, collect, transmit, distribute,
publish, or use in any other manner within the scope of the Services. This includes the control, validation, updating, removal, backup of the Contents, and
the implementation of measures to prevent their loss or alteration, even when these contents belong to third parties or are managed on their behalf; 
- complying with applicable laws, regulations, and any applicable code of ethics.
- complying with the PGSSI-S (general security policy for health information systems) if the service subject to this contract concerns health data, in accordance with requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS standard.

When the CLIENT uses the Services for professional purposes or acts on behalf of third parties, they commit to taking out civil liability insurance with a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages that could be attributed to them. They also commit to maintaining this insurance, or any other insurance offering equivalent coverage, active throughout the duration of the Contract.

### 12.4. Warranty

Each Party undertakes to conduct its activities in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The CLIENT releases
the Provider from any liability and undertakes to protect it against any consequences arising from:

- the use or exploitation of illegal Contents via the Services; 
- a fraudulent or non-compliant with current regulations use of the Services; 
- an exploitation of the Services violating the rights of third parties; 
- the choice of Services unsuitable for the needs of the CLIENT or those of third parties; 
- the loss, unauthorized or fraudulent use of User credentials.

The CLIENT also promises to actively participate in managing any request, claim, or legal action involving the Contents
or the terms of the Contract, including those from administrative or judicial authorities, and undertakes to indemnify the Provider for all
resulting damages, including any potential penalties, as well as justified defense costs.

### 12.5. Third parties

In the context of this Contract, the Provider assumes no obligation towards third parties, including Users, and no clause
should be interpreted as granting beneficiary rights to third parties. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for their interactions with third parties,
particularly with the Users of the Services, and undertakes to indemnify the Provider for any request, claim, or action from third parties that could
challenge the quality or conformity of the Services provided by the Provider.

The CLIENT also undertakes to inform the Provider, in writing and as soon as possible, of any request, claim, or action
from third parties concerning the Provider's Services, providing a detailed description of the request and all relevant information
allowing the Provider to provide the CLIENT with the necessary responses or useful documents they hold.

## 13. Force Majeure

The performance of an obligation, whatever it may be, is suspended when its performance is prevented by a force majeure event as defined by article 1218 of the Civil Code.  

Initially, force majeure events will suspend the execution of the Contract. In the event of a force majeure preventing the Provider from performing its Services:  

- Upon the occurrence of the event constituting a force majeure, Cloud Tempe will approach the CLIENT to jointly explore solutions to ensure the resumption of Services and agree by mutual agreement on the modalities for implementing these solutions, which must be implemented no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the date of occurrence of the event constituting the force majeure;  
- If the duration of this event were to exceed thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the event constituting the force majeure, or if the Parties could not agree on a replacement solution by the expiration of this same period, the CLIENT could then entrust the Services, subject of the Contract, to another Provider of his choice, thus initiating the Reversibility Phase insofar as the nature, severity, and impact of the force majeure allow;  
- Conversely, if the Provider were able to normally perform its obligations within a period of less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of occurrence of the event constituting the force majeure, with the force majeure having ceased, the Contract will resume its normal execution.   

If the force majeure event persists beyond thirty (30) calendar days, each party may terminate the Contract after sending a registered letter to the other party.  

All costs related to the implementation of the aforesaid solutions will be borne by the Party affected by the force majeure.  

## 14. Financial Conditions 

### 14.1. Applied Rates  

The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time of invoice issuance, in accordance with the conditions agreed upon at the signing of the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers various pricing grids for its Services, which may include, depending on the case, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing method. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that best suits them when placing their order.  

The prices mentioned are net of taxes for Services intended for professionals, meaning that VAT and any other relevant tax (except for the Provider's income taxes) are added to the invoiced amount. This additional imposition does not constitute a modification of the price in the sense of the article dedicated to the conditions of tariff revision.  

Unless a specific pricing is mentioned, the cost of Services also includes expenses related to the acquisition of licenses and usage rights of tools, software, and operating systems used by the Provider or, as applicable, made available to the CLIENT as part of the Services. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to obtain and pay for any license or usage right necessary for operating the content they use through the Services.  

The pricing structure of the Services and the units of measure used for calculating these prices are available on the Provider’s website. It is recommended that the CLIENT consult this information before validating their order. Any initiated unit of measure is due in full, even if it is not entirely consumed. Additionally, some Services may incur additional costs for their installation or commissioning.  

### 14.2. Price Change

The Provider reserves the right to revise its rates at its discretion. Any pricing modification will apply immediately to Orders placed after this modification. For Services already subscribed, any price increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with a thirty (30) calendar days' notice via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the opportunity, during thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the concerned Services without incurring penalties. This termination can be executed either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or through a specific form available in the CLIENT's Management Interface. In the absence of termination within this period, the CLIENT will be deemed to have accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option of termination without penalties is not offered in situations where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by Article 1195 of the Civil Code. In such circumstances, the terms specified in the said article will apply.

### 14.3. Invoicing

The billing of Services is based on the actual usage and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Provider's information system, which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of a dispute with the CLIENT. The frequency of invoicing (monthly, annually, or otherwise) as well as the timing (upon order or after delivery) differ according to the concerned Service. The billing terms are determined per the technical and commercial offer validated by the CLIENT and the Provider. Any initiated period is due on a pro-rata basis. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to familiarize themselves with these conditions before placing an order. After the settlement of each invoice, the Provider sends the CLIENT a payment receipt.

The CLIENT explicitly agrees to receive invoices electronically, which are sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to retain a copy of each invoice received, in accordance with current legal requirements.

### 14.4. Default and Late Payment

Unless a good faith dispute by the CLIENT concerns all or part of the invoice, in the event of default or delay in payment, including partial payment, the following consequences will apply:

1. late penalties will become immediately due starting the day after the due date, calculated at an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. any delay or default in payment (even partial) of the amounts due by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting more than seven (7) calendar days after the sending of a payment default notification by email, will automatically entail, without further notification or formality:   

- the immediate payment of all amounts remaining due by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the initially agreed payment method,
- the right for the Provider to immediately suspend all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid for) without notice, to refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and to proceed with the unilateral termination of the Contract, in whole or in part, by email.  

Additionally, in case of late or non-payment, professional clients are obliged to pay a fixed indemnity of forty (40) euros for recovery costs, without prejudice to the Provider's right to claim additional compensation, upon presentation of supporting documents, if the recovery costs incurred exceed this fixed amount.

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute related to billing or the specifics of the Services must be submitted to the PROVIDER's CUSTOMER Service via the CLIENT's management Interface, within a maximum period of one (1) month following the invoice issue date. Beyond this period, the CLIENT is obligated to pay the amounts due in accordance with the terms of the Contract, despite any future potential dispute of the invoice. In the event that a billing error is discovered, the Provider reserves the right to make the necessary adjustments on the respective invoices, in compliance with the applicable statute of limitations.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

Failure to comply with the Service Levels referred to in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement gives the CLIENT the right to impose penalties. The CLIENT shall request the application of penalties by e-mail within a maximum period of 90 (ninety) days after the triggering event. In case of a breach that is not the responsibility of the Provider, but of the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalty shall be applicable to the Provider.

Penalties will be calculated based on the non-compliance of the benchmark indicator. In any case, the total amount of monthly penalties cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned in the invoice of the month. When penalties are requested by the CLIENT, the payment of these penalties by the Provider shall constitute a fixed and final compensation for damages regarding the incidents leading to the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of Penalties 

**Penalties = Percentage deviation between the availability promised by the SLA of the Service considered over the calculation period and the observed availability of the considered service over the calculation period.**

_**Example: Non-compliance with SLAs 1 – 3 and 4**_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to be applied **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month's rate 80%; penalty rate to be applied **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet access 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to be applied **9.9%**_

In any case, all penalties under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the services concerned in the monthly invoice. Additionally, penalties always constitute a fixed and final compensation for damages concerning the incidents that caused the penalties, as these penalties are of a liberating nature.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit for the amount of the Regular Service the following month. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract for any reason, the Provider will pay the balance to the CLIENT by bank transfer.

## 16. Termination

### 16.1. Termination for Convenience

The CLIENT is authorized to terminate the Contract, without justification or incurring penalties, after a period of one (1) month following the activation of the Contract. To do so, they must notify their decision by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Provider.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. Termination takes effect at the end of this period. Services provided by the Provider up to the effective termination date will be billed in accordance with the terms of the Contract, without any additional indemnity. However, the CLIENT remains obligated to pay the remaining sums due for the entire duration of the Contract, including for equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination for Default

In the event of a party's failure to comply with its essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send the defaulting party a formal notice by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, granting a period of thirty (30) business days from receipt of the notification to rectify the situation.

If, after this period, the defaulting party has not remedied its default, the aggrieved party is entitled to proceed with the termination of the Contract by sending a new notification by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation being paid to the defaulting party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the losses suffered.

The decision to terminate the Contract for default incurs the responsibility of the party initiating this procedure. In the event that it is established that the party targeted by the termination has, in fact, not defaulted on its obligations, the party having initiated the termination process shall be liable to compensate the damages incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination Without Fault

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or indemnity under the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In the event of bankruptcy filing by the other party, unless the judicial administrator opts to continue the Contract within the legal time frame.
2. If a change of control occurs at the other party, in accordance with Article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in its direct or indirect possession by a competitor of the party invoking termination.
3. Non-performance of the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to a force majeure event.
4. A change in circumstances that were unforeseeable at the time of signing the Contract, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. The CLIENT's abusive and repeated use of the liability clause without foundation, placing the Provider in a financially detrimental situation or rendering the Contract unprofitable.

Upon expiration or for any other reason of Contract termination:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the reversibility phase in accordance with the terms described in the "Reversibility" article;
- The Provider is required to ensure the secure deletion of all final CLIENT data.

- This deletion involves secure erasure of all media containing these data, in compliance with the Service Agreement provisions. Following the conclusion of a Contract, regardless of the reason, the Provider is also responsible for eliminating technical data associated with the final CLIENT, including the directory, certificates, and access configuration.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include a reversibility obligation (i.e., assisting the Client in migrating its system to another Provider) except for providing the CLIENT with the technical interface and APIs enabling the CLIENT to back up and retrieve its data, including specifically the platform configuration data via one of the following technical methods at the CLIENT's choice: providing files in one or more documented and usable formats outside the service provided by the Provider or through the implementation of technical interfaces allowing data access according to a documented and usable schema (API).


The CLIENT, being the sole master of its System, must do everything necessary to facilitate this operation as needed (which implies, among other things, implementing rigorous documentation for this purpose) and the development of Reversibility plans. In the event that the CLIENT requires additional services, the Provider may offer a consulting mission in this regard under a specific contract to be negotiated. 

## 18. Confidentiality

The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, whether during negotiations or the execution of the Contract, is considered Confidential Information, regardless of its form or medium.

This includes, but is not limited to, all information related to the Contract, as well as personal, scientific, technical, technological, commercial, social, financial, legal, or any other domain data, whether patentable or not. Among this information are particularly plans, drawings, specifications, processes, know-how, designs, methods, studies, reports, forecasts of needs, software or applications, as well as information concerning prospects, client or partner names.

These Confidential Informations may be transmitted directly or indirectly to the other Party, regardless of their form (oral, written), type of documents (paper or digital), and by any means of communication. To reinforce their confidentiality:

- Specific mentions will be affixed on communication media.
- A reminder of confidentiality will be systematically made during each exchange, indicating the date and reference to this confidentiality commitment.

However, the absence of such mentions or reminders in no way affects the confidential nature of the information or the confidentiality obligations of the Parties.

The confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
- Is already in the public domain without the fault of the receiving Party;
- Was known to the receiving Party before disclosure by the transmitter, as evidenced by the archives of the receiving Party;
- Is legitimately received from a third party without confidentiality restrictions;
- Is developed independently by the receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information.

The Confidential Information must be strictly protected by the Parties and used solely for the execution of the Contract. The Parties commit to:

- Use the Confidential Information exclusively within the framework of the Contract;
- Limit the disclosure of Confidential Information to their team members involved in the execution of the Contract, ensuring their commitment to maintain confidentiality;
- Preserve the confidentiality of the Contract's content;
- Not disclose the Confidential Information to third parties without prior written consent from the other Party, except legal or judicial necessity;
- Physically protect the Confidential Information by keeping it in secure locations and taking all necessary measures for its security.

These confidentiality commitments remain in force during the duration of the Contract and for five (5) years after its conclusion or termination. At the end of the Contract, the Parties commit to returning or destroying all Confidential Information, without retaining any copies, unless otherwise instructed by the transmitting Party.

The Provider ensures that these confidentiality principles are respected by all its subcontractors during the Contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Provider must comply with the mandatory provisions of law no. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975, regarding subcontracting, and will be responsible to the CLIENT for any failure to fulfill the obligations stipulated by said law. Resorting to Subcontractors will in no way reduce the Provider's responsibility to the CLIENT under the Contract, the Provider remaining fully responsible for the execution of the Subcontracted Services with respect to the CLIENT and, more generally, for the proper execution of the Contract. 

## 20. Assignment of the Contract

The Parties agree that the Contract was concluded intuitu personae. Consequently, neither Party may assign the Contract, in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, particularly in the event of a change of control (within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial asset transfer. By way of derogation to the foregoing, each Party is authorized to assign or transfer the Contract within its group, provided it informs the other Party at least 30 days prior to the assignment or transfer operation.  

## 21. Labor Law Regulations

The Provider declares that it complies with the provisions of Articles L. 8211-1, L. 8221-1 et seq., L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4, as well as the provisions of Articles L. 8251-1 et seq. of the Labor Code, regarding the persons it employs.  

In these conditions, and in order to comply with the provisions of Articles L. 8221-1 and L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4 of the Labor Code, the Provider submits to the CLIENT, only upon the latter's request:

- All documents required by Article D. 8222-5 of the Labor Code;
- A certificate of honor against undeclared work.

The Provider also commits to applying these commitments to all its subcontractors operating throughout the duration of the contract. For services provided on the CLIENT’s premises, the Provider commits to ensure that its employees comply with all the hygiene and safety provisions in force at the CLIENT. In particular, the Provider and its subcontractors must ensure compliance with the stipulations of Decree No. 92-158 of February 20, 1992, setting special hygiene and safety prescriptions applicable to work carried out in an establishment by an outside company (Art. R. 4511-1 to R. 4515-11 of the Labor Code). 

The Parties will keep each other informed of any potential difficulties in this regard and the means to remedy them. The Contract excludes any notion of personnel provision falling within the scope of regulations concerning temporary work. 

The Provider’s personnel remain under the exclusive permanent legal subordination of the Provider, who alone has the authority to direct and supervise its employees. The CLIENT cannot give orders directly to the Provider’s personnel and/or the personnel of any of the Provider’s subcontractors. 

The Provider assumes responsibility for its personnel’s affiliation with all social organizations and bears full responsibility with respect to labor legislation. As such, the Provider certifies that it has completed the declarations required by social security organizations and does not resort to undeclared work as defined in Articles L. 8221-3 and 5 of the Labor Code. In the event that the Provider engages a subcontractor, it undertakes to ensure that said subcontractor strictly adheres to the above-mentioned legal stipulations.

In accordance with legal provisions regarding the prevention and suppression of undeclared work, the Provider commits to submit to the CLIENT at the Contract signing date and every six (6) months until completion:

- A certificate of honor for filing all mandatory tax declarations with the tax authorities at the date of the certificate, and a receipt for declaration filing;
- A social declaration certificate issued by the social protection organization responsible for recovering contributions and social contributions incumbent on the Provider, dated less than six (6) months;
- An excerpt from the commercial and company register (K or K-bis relating to the Provider) or a document compliant with the stipulations of Article D. 8222-5 of the Labor Code;
- A certificate of honor issued by the Provider, confirming the work was performed by regularly employed employees in accordance with Articles L. 1221-10, L. 3243-2, and R. 3243-1 of the Labor Code.

## 22. Ethics and Social Responsibility

In the execution of this Contract, the Parties agree to strictly adhere to the following ethical and legal principles:

- Absolute prohibition of employing minor workers, forced labor, or any form of compulsory labor, in alignment with the guidelines of the International Labour Organization (ILO);
- Elimination of any discrimination based on gender, race, color, social origin, religion, political opinion, membership in a national minority, or any other condition, in accordance with the legal provisions in force;
- Combating corruption in all its forms, ensuring complete integrity and transparency in all operations.

The Provider firmly commits to honoring and promoting the fundamental values of the European Union, such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, respect for the rule of law, as well as human rights including those of minorities. This commitment is demonstrated by constant vigilance and action to ensure that these principles are respected at all levels of their activity.

## 23. Intellectual Property

This Contract does not constitute in any way a transfer or assignment of intellectual and/or industrial property rights, including patents. It is expressly forbidden for the CLIENT to:

- Copy or reproduce in any manner whatsoever the elements used for providing services, including but not limited to computer code, texts, images, designs, graphic charters, ergonomics, documentation, etc.;
- Attempt to decompose, disassemble, or apply any form of reverse engineering to the Provider's proprietary technologies.

Despite these restrictions, the Provider grants the CLIENT a personal, non-transferable, and non-exclusive right to use the said elements solely within the framework necessary for the use of the Services and for the duration of the same. This authorization for use expires automatically with the termination of the service provision.

## 24. Non-solicitation of Personnel

Unless prior and written agreement, each Party waives the right to hire or employ directly or indirectly any member of the other Party's personnel during the duration of the Contract plus a period of one (1) year from its termination date.

Any violation by either Party of the above obligation shall result in the automatic payment by the infringing Party of a lump sum compensatory indemnity set at twelve (12) months of gross salary (fixed and variable salary) of the personnel member concerned.

The average reference salary for calculating the indemnity amount is that of the last 3 months preceding the date of termination of the employment contract.

## 25. Distinctive Signs of the Parties

Each Party is prohibited from any behavior and act likely to directly or indirectly harm the distinctive signs of the other Party, and in particular its trademarks. Without prejudice to the Provider citing the CLIENT as a reference and for the CLIENT mentioning that it uses the Provider's Services. However, each Party, without needing to justify it, may notify the other Party to no longer be cited.

## 26. Personal Data

Within the framework of these GTCU, the CLIENT commits to respecting the Provider's personal data protection policy. The CLIENT can request this policy upon request at the following address dpo@cloud-temple.fr.

The CLIENT and the Provider commit to adhering to the applicable regulations on the processing of Personal Data and, in particular, Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, relating to information technology, files, and freedoms, as amended and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Council of April 27, 2016 applicable as of May 25, 2018.

## 27. Insurance

In the event that the CLIENT plans to process critical or strategic data (such as information related to billing, payroll, research and development, etc.) using the provided services, it is the CLIENT's responsibility to take the necessary steps to subscribe to insurance dedicated to covering data losses.

## 28. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law

The Contract is governed by French law.

For any dispute arising between the Parties concerning the execution or termination of the Contract, the Parties will first attempt to find an amicable solution. In case of failure, the dispute will be submitted to the Commercial Court of Nanterre, notwithstanding multiple defendants or third-party claims, even for conservatory procedures, in summary proceedings or by petition.
