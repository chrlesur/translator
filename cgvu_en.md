This ContraThis agreement aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Service Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT with the defined Services,
specifying the scope, the modalities of execution of the Services, as well as the associated financial arrangements. The CLIENT commits to this contract in their own name and on their own behalf.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies unreserved acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU),
which the CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates in a professional capacity,
it is strongly recommended that they seek the expertise of an IT and network specialist before proceeding with the acceptance of these conditions.
This step is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly with respect to the selection
of unit characteristicsproposed solutions and the determination of resources necessary to satisfy its specific needs.

## 5. General provision

Each Party commits not to make commitments in the name and on behalf of the other Party.
The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract proves to be invalid under applicable law or an irrevocable court decision, 
this provision shall be considered unwritten. This invalidity shall not affect the overall validity of the Contract nor the force of the other provisions.

## 6. Ordering of services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to have a valid **CLIENT Account**.

proper execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to, email address, identity and contact information,
as well as relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability and up-to-date nature of this information for the entire duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or administered by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT,
this third party must attest and assure the Service Provider that they possess the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and bind them in accordance with the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT account

Prior to the activation of the CLIENT Account, as well as at any time during the provision of services, the Service Provider reserves the right to verify
the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include therequest for supporting documentation
for the information provided. The Provider also reserves the right to refuse activation or to deactivate
the CLIENT Account in the event that the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Upon activation of their CLIENT Account by the Provider, the CLIENT acquires the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the Services requested,
orders can be placed via the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The latter assumes full responsibility for the management of their CLIENT Account,
including the security of the authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT themselves, and entails their full and complete adherence to the terms of the Contract.
The modalities and deadlines for making availThe position of ordered Services varies according to the type of Service required. Some Services will only be available after 
the Service Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to verify that the conditions for providing the Services meet their requirements.

The constituent documents of the Contract complement and interpret each other coherently. Nevertheless, in case of contradiction or divergence between them, precedence 
will be given to the documents in the order in which they were listed. The annexes of the Contract, which technically detail the Services, cannot contradict 
the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without challenging the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the contract

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU) are concluded for an indefinite period, unless otherwise stipulated
in the Specific Terms and Conditions that would provide for a fixed term.

the complete recovery of their data that was stored under the concerned Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article
relating to "Data Recovery and Erasure".

The cessation of the Contract, whether initiated by the Service Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay the costs related to the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of services

The scope of services specifically encompasses:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU) in force and to comply with all guidelines provided to them at thetime of the order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, they are required, before any use
by the latter, to inform them of and have them accept the current terms of use. The CLIENT thus ensures the Provider of full compliance
with these conditions by the third parties concerned.

### 10.2. Choice of services

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT undertakes to carefully examine the current Terms of Use,
as well as to analyze in detail all the documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services offered, in order to choose Services and features

The Service Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operator

to access and use the Services. They must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and adhere to best

### 10.5. Content

In compliance with the provisions provided by the Service Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and refrains from any access to this content, except within the strict framework necessary for the provision of Services. Thus, the Service Provider does not carry out any verification, validation or updating of the mentioned content.

Similarly, it does not provide dedicated backup of content stored via the Services. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to take appropriate measures for backing up their content, in order to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, regardless of the reason, particularlythrough the use of appropriate work units in the Provider's catalog.

The managed content must be legal and used in compliance with good practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations.
The use of illicit content (such as the dissemination, publication, storage or transmission of content advocating crimes,
inciting hatred or violence against individuals based on their gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability, or violating
the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may result, at the Provider's discretion, in the immediate suspension of Services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account,
or even termination of the Contract at the CLIENT's sole fault. This is without prejudice to the Provider's right to initiate legal proceedings or claim damages for harm suffered.

### 10.6. Compliance with laws, regulations, and ethical rules

The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive
to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

which may affect the quality of Services offered to other users;
2. attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping,
spoofing, as well as any form of attack originating from the provided resources, with the exception of penetration tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. any form of SPAM or similar practicescases of "spamming";
4. the use of illegal or prohibited content, as previously described in the "Content" section.

4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Trust in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violation of the terms of use established by the Contract.

This suspension may be immediate, without prior notice, in the event of a critical situation or to prevent illicit or fraudulent use of the Services,
an infringement of third-party rights, or any act likely to engage the Service Provider's liability.
The Service Provider endeendeavors, to the extent possible and except in cases of legal necessity or violation of terms of use,
to minimize the impact of any suspension on regular service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from their obligation to pay
amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT remains informed of planned maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In the event of the CLIENT's failure to meet their obligations, these suspensions will be made without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate
the Contract or to seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in
the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are solely due to a fault of the Provider, these interruptions will not
be considered as unavailability of Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Evolution of services

The Providerreserves the right to make, at its discretion, any modification to the Services, including the addition, modification or
removal of ranges, options, features, as well as the improvement of their performance. The detailed description of the Services

which will immediately apply to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent necessities,
such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following modifications to third-party products.

In accordance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers," if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example,
the removal of a feature or a decrease in performance —, theCLIENT has the right to terminate the relevant Service. To do so, they must send a termination notice by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within sixty (60) days following the implementation of the modification.

The Service Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that, apart from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for the elements and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) thathe chooses to use or exploit within the framework of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of their content. The Service Provider undertakes not to exploit this content
for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is required not to decompile the software,

complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009,
concerning the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as American regulations such as EAR (Export Administration Regulations)

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions,
or from natural or legal persons from these countries or under sanctions. Verifications, including solvency and the potential presence of the CLIENT
